“sexually transmitted infection” sti refers to  a pathogen that causes infection through sexual contact  whereas the term “sexually transmitted disease” std refers  to a recognizable disease state that has developed from an  infection physicians and other health care providers have a  crucial role in preventing and treating stis these guidelines  are intended to assist with that effort although the guidelines  emphasize treatment prevention strategies and diagnostic  recommendations also are discussed this report updates sexually transmitted diseases treatment  guidelines 2015 1 and should be regarded as a source of  clinical guidance rather than prescriptive standards health care  providers should always consider the clinical circumstances of  each person in the context of local disease prevalence these  guidelines are applicable to any patient care setting that serves  persons at risk for stis including family planning clinics  hiv care clinics correctional health care settings private  physicians’ offices federally qualified health centers clinics  for adolescent care and other primary care facilities these  guidelines are focused on treatment and counseling and do  not address other community services and interventions that  are essential to sti and hiv prevention efforts these sti treatment guidelines complement recommendations  for providing quality sexually transmitted diseases clinical  services 2020 2 regarding quality clinical services for stis  in primary care and std specialty care settings this guidance  specifies operational determinants of quality services in various  clinical settings describes onsite treatment and partner  services and indicates when stirelated conditions should be  managed through consultation with or referral to a specialist methods these guidelines were developed by cdc staff who worked  with subject matter experts with expertise in sti clinical  management from other federal agencies nongovernmental  academic and research institutions and professional medical  organizations cdc staff identified governmental and  nongovernmental subject matter experts on the basis of their  expertise and assisted them in developing questions to guide  individual literature reviews cdc staff informed the subject  matter experts that they were being consulted to exchange  information and observations and to obtain their individual  input all subject matter experts disclosed potential conflicts  of interest sti treatment guidelines 2021 work group  members are listed at the end of this report in 2018 cdc staff identified key questions about treatment  and clinical management to guide an update of the 2015  std treatment guidelines 1 to answer these questions  and synthesize new information available since

servicescenters for disease control and prevention collaborated to conduct systematic literature reviews by using  an extensive medline database evidencebased approach for  each section of the 2015 guidelines eg using englishlanguage  published abstracts and peer reviewed journal articles these  systematic reviews were focused on four principal outcomes  of sti therapy for each disease or infection 1 treatment  of infection on the basis of microbiologic eradication  2 alleviation of signs and symptoms 3 prevention of sequelae  and 4 prevention of transmission including advantages eg  costeffectiveness singledose formulations and directly  observed therapy and disadvantages eg adverse effects  of specific regimens the outcome of the literature reviews  guided development of background materials including tables  of evidence from peerreviewed publications summarizing  the type of study eg randomized controlled trial or case  series study population and setting treatments or other  interventions outcome measures assessed reported findings  and weaknesses and biases in study design and analysis in june 2019 the subject matter experts presented their  assessments of the literature reviews at an inperson meeting  of governmental and nongovernmental participants each  key question was discussed and pertinent publications were  reviewed in terms of strengths weaknesses and relevance  participants evaluated the quality of evidence provided their  input and discussed findings in the context of the modified  rating system used by the us preventive services task force  uspstf the discussions were informal and not structured  to reach consensus cdc staff also reviewed the publications  from other professional organizations including the american  college of obstetricians and gynecologists acog uspstf  the american cancer society acs the american society  for colposcopy and cervical pathology asccp and the  advisory committee on immunization practices

search evidence tables and review process are  available at httpswwwcdcgovstdtreatmentguidelines defaulthtm cdc staff then independently reviewed the tables of evidence  prepared by the subject matter experts individual comments  from the participants and professional organizations and existing  guidelines from other organizations to determine whether  revisions to the 2015 std treatment guidelines were warranted  cdc staff ranked evidence as high medium and low on the  basis of each study’s strengths and weaknesses according to the  uspstf ratings httpswwwuspreventiveservicestaskforce orguspstfuspreventiveservicestaskforceratings cdc staff  then developed draft recommendations that were peer reviewed  by public health and clinical experts as defined by the office of  management and budget for influential scientific information  a public webinar was held to provide an overview of the draft  recommendations and invite questions and comments on the  draft recommendations the peer review comments webinar  questions and responses were considered by cdc staff in  developing the final recommendations for the updated sti  treatment guidelines recommendations for hiv hepatitis c  cervical cancer screening sti screening in pregnancy human  papillomavirus hpv testing and hepatitis a virus hav and  hepatitis b virus hbv vaccination were developed after cdc  staff reviewed existing published recommendations the english language literature was searched periodically by cdc staff to  identify subsequently published articles warranting consideration throughout this report the evidence used as the basis for  specific recommendations is discussed briefly publication  of comprehensive annotated discussions of such evidence  is planned in a supplemental issue of the journal clinical  infectious diseases after publication of the treatment guidelines  when more than one therapeutic regimen is recommended  and the listed regimens have similar efficacy and similar  rates of intolerance or toxicity the recommendations are  listed alphabetically if differences are specified regimens are  prioritized on the basis of these differences recommended  regimens should be used primarily alternative regimens can be  considered in instances of notable drug allergy or other medical  contraindications to the recommended regimens alternative  regimens are considered inferior to recommended regimens on  the basis of available evidence regarding the principal outcomes  and disadvantages of the regimens clinical prevention guidance prevention and control of stis are based on the following  five major strategies 3 1 accurate risk assessment and education and counseling  of persons at risk regarding ways to avoid stis through  changes in sexual behaviors and use of recommended  prevention services 2 preexposure vaccination for vaccinepreventable stis 3 identification of persons with an asymptomatic  infection and persons with symptoms associated with  an sti 4 effective diagnosis treatment counseling and follow up of persons who are infected with an sti 5 evaluation treatment and counseling of sex partners  of persons who are infected with an sti

disease control and prevention sti and hiv infection risk assessment primary prevention of stis includes assessment of behavioral  risk ie assessing the sexual behaviors that can place persons  at risk for infection and biologic risk ie testing for risk  markers for sti and hiv acquisition or transmission as part  of the clinical encounter health care providers should routinely  obtain sexual histories from their patients and address risk  reduction as indicated in this report guidance for obtaining  a sexual history is available at the division of std prevention  resource page httpswwwcdcgovstdtreatmentresources htm and in the curriculum provided by the national network  of std clinical prevention training centers httpswww nnptcorg effective interviewing and counseling skills  characterized by respect compassion and a nonjudgmental  attitude toward all patients are essential to obtaining a  thorough sexual history and delivering effective prevention  messages effective techniques for facilitating rapport with  patients include using openended questions eg “tell me  about any new sex partners you’ve had since your last visit” and  “what has your experience with using condoms been like”  understandable nonjudgmental language eg “what gender  are your sex partners”and “have you ever had a sore or scab  on your penis” and normalizing language eg “some of my  patients have difficulty using a condom with every sex act how  is it for you” the “five p’s” approach to obtaining a sexual  history is one strategy for eliciting information about the key  areas of interest box 1 in addition health care professionals  can consider assessing sexual history by asking patients such  questions as “do you have any questions or concerns about  your sexual health” additional information about gaining  cultural competency when working with certain populations  eg gay bisexual or other men who have sex with men  msm women who have sex with women wsw or with  women and men wswm or transgender men and women  or adolescents is available in sections of these guidelines related  to these populations in addition to obtaining a behavioral risk assessment a  comprehensive sti and hiv risk assessment should include  sti screening as recommended in these guidelines because  stis are biologic markers of risk particularly for hiv  acquisition and transmission among certain msm in most  clinical settings sti screening is an essential and underused  component of an sti and hiv risk assessment persons  seeking treatment or evaluation for a particular sti should be  screened for hiv and other stis as indicated by community  prevalence and individual risk factors see chlamydial  infections gonococcal infections syphilis persons should  be informed about all the tests for stis they are receiving and  notified about tests for common stis eg genital herpes  box 1 the five p’s approach for health care providers obtaining sexual histories partners practices protection from sexually  transmitted infections past history of sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy intention 1 partners • “are you currently having sex of any kind” • “what is the genders of your partners” 2 practices • “to understand any risks for sexually transmitted  infections stis i need to ask more specific questions  about the kind of sex you have had recently” • “what kind of sexual contact do you have or have you had”  ű “do you have vaginal sex meaning ‘penis in vagina’ sex”  ű “do you have anal sex meaning ‘penis in rectumanus’  sex”  ű “do you have oral sex meaning ‘mouth on penisvagina’” 3 protection from stis • “do you and your partners discuss prevention of stis  and human immunodeficiency virus hiv” • “do you and your partners discuss getting tested” • for condoms  ű “what protection methods do you use in what  situations do you use condoms” 4 past history of stis • “have you ever been tested for stis and hiv” • “have you ever been diagnosed with an sti in the past” • “have any of your partners had an sti” additional questions for identifying hiv and viral  hepatitis risk • “have you or any of your partners ever injected drugs” • “is there anything about your sexual health that you  have questions about” 5 pregnancy intention • “do you think you would like to have more children  in the future” •  “how important is it to you to prevent pregnancy  until then” • “are you or your partner using contraception or  practicing any form of birth control” • “would you like to talk about ways to prevent  pregnancy”

patients all  providers should encourage risk reduction by offering  prevention counseling prevention counseling is most effective  if provided in a nonjudgmental and empathetic manner  appropriate to the patient’s culture language sex and gender  identity sexual orientation age and developmental level  prevention counseling for stis and hiv should be offered  to all sexually active adolescents and to all adults who have  received an sti diagnosis have had an sti during the  previous year or have had multiple sex partners uspstf  recommends intensive behavioral counseling for all sexually  active adolescents and for adults at increased risk for stis and  hiv 4 such interactive counseling which can be resource  intensive is directed at a person’s risk the situations in which  risk occurs and the use of personalized goalsetting strategies  one such approach known as clientcentered sti and hiv  prevention counseling involves tailoring a discussion of risk  reduction to the person’s situation although one large study in  sti clinics project respect demonstrated that this approach  was associated with lower acquisition of curable stis eg  trichomoniasis chlamydia gonorrhea and syphilis 5 another  study conducted 10 years later in the same settings but different  contexts project aware did not replicate this result 6 with the challenges that intensive behavioral counseling poses  health care professionals might find brief prevention messages  and those delivered through video or in a group session to be  more accessible for the client a review of 11 studies evaluated  brief prevention messages delivered by providers and health  counselors and reported them to be feasible and to decrease  subsequent stis in std clinic settings 7 and hiv care  settings 8 other approaches use motivational interviewing  to move clients toward achievable riskreduction goals client centered counseling and motivational interviewing can be used  effectively by clinicians and staff trained in these approaches  cdc provides additional information on these and other  effective behavioral interventions at httpswwwcdcgov stdprograminterventionshtm training in clientcentered  counseling and motivational interviewing is available through  the std national network of prevention training centers  httpswwwnnptcorg in addition to oneonone sti and hiv prevention  counseling videos and large group presentations can provide  explicit information concerning stis and reducing disease  transmission eg how to use condoms consistently and  correctly and the importance of routine screening group based strategies have been effective in reducing the occurrence  of stis among persons at risk including those attending  std clinics 9 brief online electroniclearning modules for  young msm have been reported to be effective in reducing  incident stis and offer a convenient client platform for  effective interventions 10 because the incidence of certain  stis most notably syphilis is higher among persons with  hiv infection use of clientcentered sti counseling for  persons with hiv continues to be encouraged by public health  agencies and other health organizations httpswwwcdcgov stdstatistics2019defaulthtm a 2014 guideline from cdc  the health resources and services administration and the  national institutes of health recommends that clinical and  nonclinical providers assess a person’s behavioral and biologic  risks for acquiring or transmitting stis and hiv including  having sex without condoms having recent stis and having  partners recently treated for stis httpsstackscdcgov viewcdc44064 that federal guideline is for clinical and  nonclinical providers to offer or make referral for regular  screening for multiple stis onsite sti treatment when  indicated and riskreduction interventions tailored to the  person’s risks brief riskreduction counseling delivered by  medical providers during hiv primary care visits coupled  with routine sti

condoms are effective in  preventing the sexual transmission of hiv infection http wwwashasexualhealthorgpdfsmaleandfemalecondoms pdf in heterosexual hiv mixedstatus relationships ie those  involving one infected and one uninfected partner in which  condoms were used consistently hivnegative partners were  71–80 less likely to become infected with hiv compared  with persons in similar relationships in which condoms were  not used 1415 two analyses of msm mixedstatus couple  studies estimated the protective effect of condom use to be 70  and 91 respectively 1617 moreover studies demonstrate  that consistent condom use reduces the risk for other stis  including chlamydia gonorrhea hepatitis b and trichomoniasis  18–21 by limiting lower genital tract infections condoms  also might reduce the risk for pelvic inflammatory disease  pid among women 22 in addition consistent and correct  use of latex condoms reduces the risk for hpv infection  and hpvassociated diseases genital herpes syphilis and  chancroid when the infected area or site of potential exposure  is covered 23–27 additional information is available at  httpswwwcdcgovcondomeffectivenessindexhtml and  wwwfactsaboutcondomscomprofessionalphp condoms  are regulated as medical devices and are subject to random  sampling and testing by the food and drug administration  fda each latex condom manufactured in the united states  is tested electronically for holes before packaging the rate of  condom breakage during sexual intercourse and withdrawal in  the united states is approximately two broken condoms per  100 condoms rates of breakage and slippage might be slightly  higher during anal intercourse 2829 the failure of condoms  to protect against stis or unintended pregnancy usually results  from inconsistent or incorrect use rather than condom breakage  30 users should check the expiration or manufacture date  on the box or individual package latex condoms should not  be used beyond their expiration date or 5 years after the  manufacturing date condoms made of materials other than  latex are available in the united states and can be classified  into two general categories 1 polyurethane polyisoprene or  other synthetic condoms and 2 natural membrane condoms polyurethane external condoms provide protection against  stis and hiv and pregnancy comparable to that of latex  condoms 2031 these can be substituted for latex condoms  by persons with latex sensitivity are typically more resistant to  deterioration and are compatible with use of both oilbased  and waterbased lubricants the effectiveness of other synthetic  external condoms to prevent stis has not been extensively  studied and fda labeling restricts their recommended use  to persons who are sensitive to or allergic to latex natural  membrane condoms frequently called natural skin condoms  or incorrectly lambskin condoms are made from lamb cecum  and can have pores up to 1500 nm in diameter although  these pores do not allow the passage of sperm they are more  than 10 times the diameter of hiv and more than 25 times  that of hbv moreover laboratory studies demonstrate that  sexual transmission of viruses including hbv herpes simplex  virus hsv and hiv can occur with natural membrane  condoms 31 therefore natural membrane condoms are not  recommended for prevention of stis and hiv providers should advise that condoms must be used  consistently and correctly to be effective in preventing stis and  hiv while noting that any condom use is better than no condom  use providing instructions about the correct use of condoms  can be useful communicating the following recommendations  can help ensure that patients use external condoms correctly • use a new condom with each sex act ie oral vaginal  and anal • carefully handle the condom to avoid damaging it with  fingernails teeth or other sharp objects • put the condom on after the penis is erect and before any  genital oral or anal contact with the partner • use only waterbased or siliconebased lubricants eg  ky jelly astroglide aqualube or glycerin with latex  condoms oilbased lubricants eg petroleum jelly  shortening mineral oil massage oils body lotions or  cooking oil can weaken latex and should not be used  however oilbased lubricants typically can be used with  polyurethane or other synthetic condoms • ensure adequate lubrication during vaginal and anal sex  which might require using exogenous waterbased  lubricants • hold the condom firmly against the base of the penis  during withdrawal and withdraw while the penis is still  erect to prevent the condom from slipping off httpswwwcdcgovvaccineshcpaciprecsvaccspecificindexhtml httpswwwcdcgovvaccineshcpaciprecsvaccspecificindexhtml

partner decreased the risk for transmission to the uninfected  partner by 96 94 therefore art not only is beneficial to  the health of persons with hiv infection it also reduces the  risk for transmission additional studies of hiv mixedstatus  couples heterosexual and msm couples partner study  and msm couples opposites attract and partners2  studies reported that patients with hiv taking art who  maintain an undetectable viral load demonstrate no risk for  transmitting hiv to their hivnegative sex partners 95–97  for those reasons art should be offered to all persons with  hiv infection to obtain viral suppression detailed guidance  regarding art regimens is available in the us department of  health and human services’ hiv treatment guidelines 98 hiv seroadaptive strategies seroadaptive strategies for hiv prevention have largely  originated within communities of msm they are predicated  on knowledge of self and partner hiv status one specific  seroadaptive practice is serosorting which includes limiting  anal sex without a condom to partners with the same hiv  status as their own or choosing to selectively use condoms  with hiv mixedstatus partners another practice among  mixedstatus couples is seropositioning in which the  person with hiv infection is the receptive partner for anal  intercourse observational studies have consistently reported  that serosorting confers greater risk for hiv infection than  consistent condom use but has lower risk compared with anal  intercourse without a condom and without serosorting 99– 101 serosorting practices have been associated with increased  risk for stis including chlamydia and gonorrhea 102103 serosorting is not recommended for the following reasons  many msm who have hiv infection do not know they  have hiv because they have not been tested recently men’s  assumptions about the hiv status of their partners might be  wrong and some men with hiv infection might not disclose or  might misrepresent their hiv status all of these factors increase  httpswwwcdcgovhivpdfprogramresourcescdchivnpepguidelinespdf httpswwwcdcgovhivpdfprogramresourcescdchivnpepguidelinespdf

“partner services” refers to a continuum of clinical  evaluation counseling diagnostic testing and treatment  designed to increase the number of infected persons brought to  treatment and to reduce transmission among sexual networks  this continuum includes efforts of health departments  medical providers and patients themselves the term “public  health partner services” refers to efforts by public health  departments to identify the sex and needlesharing partners  of infected persons to ensure their medical evaluation and  treatment health departments are increasingly incorporating  referral to additional services as indicated into the partner services  continuum aside from the general benefit to patients and partners  service referrals and linkage can mitigate the circumstances that  increase risk for future sti and hiv acquisition the types and comprehensiveness of public health partner  services and the specific stis for which they are offered vary  by public health agency their resources and the geographic  prevalence of stis in most areas of the united states health  departments routinely attempt to provide partner services to  all persons with infectious syphilis primary or secondary  and persons with a new diagnosis of hiv infection health  departments should provide partner services for persons who  might have cephalosporinresistant gonorrhea in contrast  relatively few us health departments routinely provide  sti partner services to persons with gonorrhea chlamydia  trichomoniasis or other stis 105 because sti diagnoses  often can serve as risk markers for hiv acquisition 83 public  health services might include followup of msm with an sti  to offer hiv prep public health services can also include hiv  and sti prevention interventions including hiv and sti  testing linkage and relinkage of persons with hiv infection  to hiv care clinics and referral of partners of persons with  stis or hiv infection to hiv prep as indicated 106–109  clinicians should familiarize themselves with public health  practices in their area however in most instances providers  should understand that responsibility for discussing the  treatment of partners of persons with stis rests with the  diagnosing provider and the patient state laws require a good  faith effort by the provider to inform partners and providers  should familiarize themselves with public health laws clinicians who do not notify partners of patients directly  can still provide partner services by counseling infected persons  and providing them with written information and medication  to give to their partners if recommended and allowable by  state law directly evaluating and treating sex partners and  cooperating with state and local health departments clinicians’  efforts to ensure treatment of patients’ sex partners can reduce  the risk for reinfection and potentially diminish transmission  of stis 110 therefore clinicians should encourage all  persons with stis to notify their sex partners and urge them  to seek medical evaluation and treatment exceptions to this  practice include circumstances posing a risk for intimate  partner violence 111 available data are limited regarding  the rate of intimate partner violence directly attributable  to partner notification 112113 however because of the  reported prevalence of intimate partner violence in the general  population 114 providers should consider the potential  risk before notifying partners of persons or encouraging  partner notification time spent counseling patients about the  importance of notifying partners is associated with improved  notification outcomes 115 when possible clinicians should  advise persons to bring their primary sex partner with them  when returning for treatment and should concurrently treat  both persons although this approach can be effective for a  main partner 116117 it might not be a feasible approach  for additional sex partners evidence indicates that providing  patients with written information to share with sex partners  can increase rates of partner treatment 110 certain health departments now use technology eg  email texting mobile applications and social media outlets  to facilitate partner services for locating and notifying the  sex partners of persons with stis including hiv 118119  patients now have the option to use internet sites to send  anonymous email or text messages advising partners of their  exposure to an sti 120 anonymous notification via the  recommendations and reports 10 mmwr  july 23 2021  vol 70

medical provider or public health professional to notify their  sex partners expedited partner therapy expedited partner therapy ept is a harmreduction  strategy and the clinical practice of treating the sex partners  of persons with diagnosed chlamydia or gonorrhea who are  unable or unlikely to seek timely treatment by providing  medications or prescriptions to the patient as allowable by law  patients then provide partners with these therapies without  the health care provider having examined the partner https wwwcdcgovstdept unless prohibited by law or other  regulations medical providers should routinely offer ept  to patients with chlamydia when the provider cannot ensure  that all of a patient’s sex partners from the previous 60 days  will seek timely treatment if the patient has not had sex  during the 60 days before diagnosis providers should offer  ept for the patient’s most recent sex partner because ept  must be an oral regimen and current gonorrhea treatment  involves an injection ept for gonorrhea should be offered  to partners unlikely to access timely evaluation after linkage  is explored ept is legal in the majority of states but varies  by chlamydial or gonococcal infection providers should visit  httpswwwcdcgovstdept to obtain updated information for  their state providing patients with packaged oral medication  is the preferred approach because the efficacy of ept using  prescriptions has not been evaluated obstacles to ept can exist  at the pharmacy level 121122 and many persons especially  adolescents do not fill the prescriptions provided to them by  a sex partner 123124 medication or prescriptions provided  for ept should be accompanied by educational materials for  the partner including treatment instructions warnings about  taking medications eg if the partner is pregnant or has an  allergy to the medication general health counseling and a  statement advising that partners seek medical evaluation as  soon as possible for hiv infection and any symptoms of stis  particularly pid evidence supporting ept is based on three us clinical  trials involving heterosexual men and women with chlamydia  or gonorrhea 125–127 all three trials reported that more  partners were treated when patients were offered ept two  reported statistically significant decreases in the rate of  reinfection and one observed a lower risk for persistent or  recurrent infection that was statistically nonsignificant a  fourth trial in the united kingdom did not demonstrate a  difference in the risk for reinfection or in the numbers of  partners treated between persons offered ept and those  advised to notify their sex partners 128 us trials and a  metaanalysis of ept revealed that the magnitude of reduction  in reinfection of index patients compared with patient referral  differed according to the sti and the sex of the index patient  110125–127 however across trials reductions in chlamydia  prevalence at followup were approximately 20 and  reductions in gonorrhea were approximately 50 at followup existing data indicate that ept also might have a role in  partner management for trichomoniasis however no partner  management intervention has been reported to be more  effective than any other in reducing trichomoniasis reinfection  rates 129130 no data support use of ept in the routine  management of patients with syphilis data are limited regarding use of ept for gonococcal  or chlamydial infections among msm compared with  heterosexuals 131132 published studies including recent  data regarding

are strategies that  should be incorporated into all types of health care visits for  adolescents and young adults the following recommendations  for primary prevention of stis ie vaccination and  counseling are based on published clinical guidelines for  sexually active adolescents and young adults from federal  agencies and medical professional organizations • hpv vaccination is recommended through age 26 years  for those not vaccinated previously at the routine age of  11 or 12 years httpswwwcdcgovvaccineshcpacip recsvaccspecifichpvhtml • the hbv vaccination series is recommended for all adolescents  and young adults who have not previously received the universal  hbv vaccine series during childhood 12 • the hav vaccination series should be offered to  adolescents and young adults as well as those who have  not previously received the universal hav vaccine series  during childhood httpswwwcdcgovvaccines scheduleshcpimzchildindicationshtmlnotehepa • information regarding hiv transmission prevention testing  and implications of infection should be regarded as an essential  component of the anticipatory guidance provided to all  adolescents and young adults as part of routine health care • cdc and uspstf recommend offering hiv prep to  adolescents weighing ≥35 kg and adults who are hiv  negative and at substantial risk for hiv infection 80178  ymsm should be offered prep in youthfriendly settings  with tailored adherence support eg text messaging and  visits per existing guidelines indications for prep initial  and followup prescribing guidance and laboratory testing  recommendations are the same for adolescents and adults  httpswwwcdcgovhivriskprep • medical providers who care for adolescents and young  adults should integrate sexuality education into clinical  practice health care providers should counsel adolescents  about the sexual behaviors that are associated with risk for  acquiring stis and should educate patients regarding  evidencebased prevention strategies which includes a  discussion about abstinence and other riskreduction  behaviors eg consistent and correct condom use and  reduction in the number of sex partners including  concurrent partners interactive counseling approaches  eg patientcentered counseling and motivational  interviewing are effective sti and hiv prevention  strategies and are recommended by uspstf educational  materials eg handouts pamphlets and videos can  reinforce officebased educational efforts children management of children who have stis requires close  cooperation among clinicians laboratorians and child protection authorities official investigations when indicated  should be initiated promptly certain diseases eg gonorrhea  syphilis hiv chlamydia and trichomoniasis if acquired after  the neonatal period strongly indicate sexual contact for other  diseases eg hsv hpv and anogenital warts and vaginitis  the association with sexual contact is not as clear see sexual  assault and abuse and stis men who have sex with men msm comprise a diverse group in terms of behaviors  identities and health care needs 179 the term “msm” often  is used clinically to refer to sexual behavior alone regardless of  sexual orientation eg a person might identify as heterosexual  but still be classified as msm sexual orientation is  independent of gender identity classification of msm can vary  in the inclusion of transgender men and women on the basis  of whether men are defined by sex at birth ie transgender  women included or current gender identity ie transgender  men included therefore sexual orientation as well as gender  identity of individual persons and their sex partners should be  obtained during health care visits msm might be at increased  risk for hiv and other stis because of their sexual network or  behavioral or biologic factors including number of concurrent  partners condomless sex anal sex or substance use 180–182  these factors along with sexual network or higher community  disease prevalence can increase the risk for stis among msm  compared with other groups 183184 performing a detailed and comprehensive sexual history is  the first step in identifying vulnerability and providing tailored  counseling and care 3 factors associated with increased  vulnerability to sti acquisition among msm include having  multiple partners anonymous

suboptimal because providers might feel uncomfortable  taking a detailed sexual history 229 men might also feel  uncomfortable sharing personal sexual information with  their provider and rectal and

to effectively engage different groups of msm  outreach efforts should be guided by local surveillance efforts  and community input engaging msm at risk through social  media specifically online hookup sites is an important  outreach effort to consider hookup sites are internet sites  and mobile telephone applications that men might use for  meeting other men for sex internet use might facilitate sexual  encounters and sti transmission among msm and many  men report using hookup sites to meet partners 242–245  the ease and accessibility of meeting partners online might  reduce stigma and barriers of meeting partners through  other settings moreover these sites offer an opportunity for  effective sti prevention messaging 246 although the cost  might be limiting 247 different

gonorrhea syphilis and lymphogranuloma venereum lgv  this includes multiple sex partners and online hookup sites  that increase opportunities for sexual mixing which might  create dense sexual networks that facilitate sti transmission  among msm 270 specific behaviors associated with sexually  transmitted enteric infections among msm involve attendance  at sex parties and recreational drug use including chem sex  ie using crystal methamphetamine gammabutyrolactone  or mephedrone before or during sex which might facilitate  condomless sex group sex fisting use of sex toys and scat play  253271 the growing number of sexually transmitted enteric  infections might be attributable in part to the emergence of  antimicrobial resistance this is well reported regarding shigella  species for which rapid intercontinental dissemination of a  s flexneri 3a lineage with highlevel resistance to azithromycin  through sexual transmission among msm 272 and clusters  of multidrug resistant shigella cases among msm have recently  been reported 273 multidrugresistant campylobacter species  have also been documented 266274 for msm patients with  diarrhea clinicians should request

open discussion  about sexual health few data are available regarding the risk for stis conferred  by sex between women however transmission risk probably  varies by the specific sti and sexual practice eg oralgenital  sex vaginal or anal sex using hands fingers or penetrative  sex items and oralanal sex 291292 practices involving  digitalvaginal or digitalanal contact particularly with shared  penetrative sex items present a possible means for transmission  of infected cervicovaginal or anal secretions this possibility  is most directly supported by reports of shared trichomonas  infections 293294 and by concordant drugresistance  genotype testing and phylogenetic linkage analysis identifying  hiv transmitted sexually between women 295296 the  majority of wsw 53–97 have had

transgender women should have  knowledge of their patients’ current anatomy and patterns  of sexual behavior before counseling them about sti and  hiv prevention the majority of transgender women have  not undergone genitalaffirmation surgery and therefore  might retain a functional penis in these instances they  might engage in insertive oral vaginal or anal sex as well as  receptive oral or anal

transgender men and gender diverse persons assigned  female sex at birth who have undergone genderaffirmation  genital surgery is low providers should consider the anatomic  diversity among transgender men because a person can undergo  a metoidioplasty a procedure to increase the length of the  clitoris with or without urethral lengthening and might not  have a hysterectomy and oophorectomy and therefore be at risk  for bacterial stis hpv hsv hiv and cervical cancer 366  for transgender men using genderaffirming hormone therapy  the decrease in estradiol levels caused by

susceptibility  to hiv and stis is unknown transgender men who have not chosen to undergo  hysterectomy with removal of the cervix remain at risk for  cervical cancer these persons often avoid cervical cancer  screening because of multiple factors including discomfort  with medical examinations and fear of discrimination  338370 providers should be aware that conducting a  speculum examination can be technically difficult after  metoidioplasty surgery because of narrowing of the introitus  in these situations highrisk hpv testing using a swab can  be considered selfcollected swabs for highrisk hpv testing  has been reported to be an acceptable option for transgender  men 371 screening recommendations the following are screening recommendations for  transgender and gender diverse persons • because of the diversity of transgender persons regarding  surgical genderaffirming procedures hormone use and  their patterns of sexual behavior providers should remain  aware of symptoms consistent with common stis and  screen for asymptomatic infections on the basis of the  patient’s sexual practices and anatomy • genderbased screening recommendations should be  adapted on the basis of anatomy eg routine screening  for c trachomatis and n gonorrhoeae as recommended  for all sexually active females aged 25 years on an annual  basis and should be extended to transgender men and  nonbinary persons with a cervix among this age group • hiv screening should be discussed and offered to all  transgender persons frequency of repeat screenings should  be based on level of risk • for transgender persons with hiv infection who have sex  with cisgender men and transgender women sti  screening should be conducted at least annually including  syphilis serology hcv testing and urogenital and  extragenital naat for gonorrhea and chlamydia • transgender women who have had vaginoplasty surgery  should undergo routine sti screening for all exposed sites  eg oral anal or vaginal no data are available regarding  the optimal screening method urine or vaginal swab for  bacterial stis of the neovagina the usual techniques for  creating a neovagina do not result in a cervix therefore  no rationale exists for cervical cancer screening 368 • if transgender men have undergone metoidioplasty surgery  with urethral lengthening and have not had a vaginectomy  assessment of genital bacterial stis should include a  cervical swab because a urine specimen will be inadequate  for detecting cervical infections • cervical cancer screening for transgender men and  nonbinary persons with a cervix should follow current  screening guidelines see human papillomavirus infections persons in correctional facilities multiple studies have demonstrated that persons entering  correctional facilities have a high prevalence of stis hiv and  viral hepatitis especially those aged ≤35 years 141372373  risk behaviors for acquiring stis eg having condomless  sex having multiple sex partners substance misuse and  engaging in commercial survival or coerced sex are common  among incarcerated populations before their incarceration  many persons have had limited access to medical care other  social determinants of health eg insufficient social and  economic support or living in communities with high local  sti prevalence are common addressing stis in correctional  settings is vital for addressing the overall sti impact among  affected populations growing evidence demonstrates the usefulness of expanded  sti screening and treatment services in correctional settings  including shortterm facilities jails longterm institutions  prisons and juvenile detention centers for example in  jurisdictions with comprehensive targeted jail screening more  chlamydial infections among females and males if screened  are detected and subsequently treated in the correctional setting  than in any other single reporting source 141374 and might  represent the majority of reported

previously treated or current infection are  considerably higher among incarcerated adult men and women  than among adolescents which is consistent with the overall  national syphilis trends 141374 detection and treatment  of early syphilis in correctional facilities might affect rates  of transmission among adults and prevention of congenital  syphilis 377 in jails approximately half of entrants are released back  into the community within 48 hours as a result treatment  completion rates for those screened for stis and who receive  sti diagnoses in shortterm facilities might not be optimal  however because of the mobility of incarcerated populations  in and out of the community the impact of screening in  correctional facilities on the prevalence of infections among  detainees and subsequent transmission in the community  after release might be considerable 378 moreover treatment  completion rates of ≥95 in shortterm facilities can be  achieved by offering screening at or shortly after intake  thus facilitating earlier receipt of test results and if needed  followup of untreated persons can be conducted through  public health outreach universal optout screening for

rapid linkage to care are  essential for achieving these goals guidelines from both the  us department of health and human services and the  international aids society–usa panel recommend that all  persons with hiv infection be offered effective art as soon  as possible both to reduce morbidity and mortality and to  prevent hiv transmission 413 std specialty or sexual health clinics are a vital partner in  reducing hiv infections in the united states these clinics  provide safety net services to vulnerable populations in need  of hiv prevention services who are not served by the health  care

known to have hiv infection  testing should be routine at the time of the sti evaluation  regardless of whether the patient reports any specific behavioral  risks for hiv testing for hiv should be performed at the time  of sti diagnosis and treatment if not performed at the initial  sti evaluation and screening 82195416 • cdc and uspstf recommend hiv screening at least  once for all persons aged 15–65 years 417 • persons at higher risk for hiv acquisition including  sexually active gay bisexual and other msm should be  screened for hiv at least annually providers can consider  the benefits of offering more frequent screening eg every  3–6 months among msm at increased risk for acquiring  hiv 418419 • all pregnant women should be tested for hiv during the  first prenatal visit a second test during the third trimester  preferably at 36 weeks’ gestation should be considered  and is recommended for women who are at high risk for  acquiring hiv infection women who receive health care  in jurisdictions with high rates of hiv and women  examined in clinical settings in which hiv incidence  is  ≥1 per 1000 women screened per year 138140  • hiv screening should be voluntary and free from coercion  patients should not be tested without their knowledge • optout hiv screening notifying the patient that an hiv  test will be performed unless the patient declines is  recommended in all health care settings cdc also  recommends that consent for hiv screening be  incorporated into the general informed consent for  medical care in the same manner as other screening or  diagnostic tests • requirement of specific signed consent for hiv testing is  not recommended general informed consent for medical  care is considered sufficient to encompass informed  consent for hiv testing • providers should use a laboratorybased antigenantibody  agab combination assay as the first test for hiv unless  persons are unlikely to follow up with a provider to receive  their hiv test results in those cases screening with a rapid  poc test can be useful • preliminary positive screening tests for hiv should be  followed by supplemental testing to establish the diagnosis • providing prevention counseling as part of hiv screening  programs or in conjunction with hiv diagnostic testing is  not required 6 however persons might be more likely to  think about hiv and consider their riskrelated behavior  when undergoing an hiv test hiv testing gives providers  an opportunity to conduct sti and hiv prevention  counseling and communicate riskreduction messages • acute hiv infection can occur among persons who report  recent sexual or needlesharing behavior or who have had  an sti diagnosis • providers should test for hiv rna if initial testing according  to the hiv testing algorithm recommended by cdc is  negative or indeterminate when concerned about acute hiv  infection httpsstackscdcgovviewcdc50872 httpsstackscdcgovviewcdc50872 recommendations and reports mmwr  july 23 2021  vol 70  no 4 25us department of health and human servicescenters for disease control and prevention • providers should not assume that a laboratory report of a  negative hiv agab or antibody test indicates that the requisite  hiv rna testing for acute hiv infection has been conducted  they should consider explicitly requesting hiv rna testing  when concerned about early acute hiv infection • providers should assess eligibility of all persons seeking  sti services for hiv prep and pep for persons with  substantial risk whose results are hiv negative providers  should offer or provide referral for prep services unless  the last potential hiv exposure occurred 72 hours in  which case pep might be indicated diagnostic considerations hiv infection can be diagnosed by hiv 12 agab  combination immunoassays all fdacleared hiv tests are  highly sensitive and specific available serologic tests can  detect all known subtypes of hiv1 the majority also detect  hiv2 and uncommon variants of hiv1 eg group o and  group n according to an algorithm for hiv diagnosis cdc  recommends that hiv testing begin with a laboratory based hiv1hiv2 agab combination assay which if  repeatedly reactive is followed by a laboratorybased assay  with a supplemental hiv1hiv2 antibody differentiation  assay httpsstackscdcgovviewcdc50872 this algorithm  confers an additional advantage because it can detect hiv2  antibodies after the initial immunoassay although hiv2 is  uncommon in the united states accurate identification is  vital because monitoring and therapy for hiv2 differs from  that for hiv1 420 rna testing should be performed  on all specimens with reactive immunoassay but negative  supplemental antibody test results to determine whether the  discordance represents acute hiv infection rapid poc hiv tests can enable clinicians to make a  preliminary diagnosis of hiv infection in 20 minutes the  majority of rapid antibody assays become reactive later in the  course of hiv infection than conventional laboratorybased  assays and thus can produce negative results among persons  recently infected eg acutely infected persons furthermore  hiv hometest kits only detect hiv antibodies and therefore  will not detect acute hiv infection if early or acute infection  is suspected and a rapid hiv antibody assay is negative  confirmatory testing with combined laboratorybased assays or  rna testing should be performed cdc recommends that all  persons with reactive rapid tests be assessed with a laboratory based agab assay additional details about interpretation of  results by using the hiv testing algorithm recommended by  cdc are available at httpsstackscdcgovviewcdc48472 acute hiv infection providers serving persons at risk for stis are in a position  to diagnose hiv infection during its acute phase diagnosing  hiv infection during the acute phase is particularly important  because persons with acute hiv have highly infectious  disease due to the concentration of

provider provided prevention counseling eg advised to  reduce the number of partners and to use condoms correctly  and consistently and screened for stis information should be  provided regarding availability of pep for sexual and injecting  drug use partners not known to have hiv infection if the  most recent contact was 72 hours preceding hiv diagnosis when providers test by using the cdc algorithm specimens  collected during acute infection might give indeterminate or  negative results because insufficient antihiv antibodies and  potentially insufficient antigen are present to be

cause of ulcers  that are unusual or that do not respond to initial therapy hiv  testing should be performed on all persons not known to have  hiv infection who present with genital anal or perianal ulcers  see diagnostic considerations in diseasespecific sections  naat testing at extragenital sites should be considered for  cases in which guds are suspected eg oral manifestations  of syphilis herpes or lgv commercially available naats  have not been cleared by fda for these indications however  they can be used by laboratories that have met regulatory  requirements for an offlabel procedure because early syphilis treatment decreases transmission  possibility public health standards require health care  providers to presumptively treat any patient with a suspected  case of infectious syphilis at the initial visit even before test  results are available presumptive treatment of a patient with a  suspected first episode of genital herpes also is recommended  because hsv treatment benefits depend on prompt therapy  initiation the clinician should choose the presumptive  treatment on the basis of the clinical presentation ie hsv  lesions begin as vesicles and primary syphilis as a papule and  epidemiologic circumstances eg high incidence of disease  among populations and communities and travel history for  example syphilis is so common among msm that any male  who has sex with men presenting with a genital ulcer should be  presumptively treated for syphilis at the initial visit after syphilis  and hsv tests are performed after a complete diagnostic  evaluation 25 of patients who have genital ulcers might  not have a laboratoryconfirmed diagnosis 426 chancroid chancroid prevalence has declined in the united states  141 when infection does occur it is usually associated  with sporadic outbreaks worldwide chancroid appears to  have decreased as well although infection might still occur in  certain africa regions and the caribbean chancroid is a risk  factor in hiv transmission and acquisition 197 diagnostic considerations a definitive diagnosis of chancroid requires identifying  h ducreyi on special culture media that is not widely  available from commercial sources even when these media  are used sensitivity is 80 427 no fdacleared naat  for h ducreyi is available in the united states however  such testing can be performed by clinical laboratories that  have developed their own naat and have conducted clia  verification studies on genital specimens the combination of one or more deep and painful  genital ulcers and tender suppurative inguinal adenopathy  indicates the chancroid diagnosis inguinal lymphadenitis  typically occurs in 50 of cases 428 for both clinical and  surveillance purposes a probable diagnosis of chancroid can  be made if all of the following four criteria are met 1 the  patient has one or more painful genital ulcers 2 the clinical  presentation appearance of genital ulcers and if present  regional lymphadenopathy are typical for chancroid 3 the  patient has no evidence of t pallidum infection by darkfield  examination or naat ie ulcer exudate or serous fluid or  by serologic tests for syphilis performed at least 7–14 days  after onset of ulcers and 4 hsv1 or hsv2 naat or hsv  culture performed on the ulcer exudate or fluid are negative treatment successful antimicrobial treatment for chancroid cures  the infection resolves the clinical symptoms and prevents  transmission to others in advanced cases genital scarring and  rectal or urogenital fistulas from suppurative buboes can result  despite successful therapy recommendations and reports mmwr  july 23 2021  vol 70  no 4 29us department of health and human servicescenters for disease control and prevention recommended regimens for chancroid azithromycin 1 g orally in a single dose or ceftriaxone 250 mg im in a single dose or ciprofloxacin 500 mg orally 2 timesday for 3 days or erythromycin base 500 mg orally 3 timesday for 7 days azithromycin and ceftriaxone offer the advantage of  singledose therapy 429 worldwide several isolates with  intermediate resistance to either ciprofloxacin or erythromycin  have been reported however because cultures are not routinely  performed and chancroid is uncommon data are limited  regarding prevalence of h ducreyi antimicrobial resistance other management considerations men who are uncircumcised and persons with hiv infection  do not respond as well to treatment as persons who are  circumcised or are hiv negative 430 patients should be  tested for hiv at the time chancroid is diagnosed if the initial  hiv test results were negative the provider can consider the  benefits of offering more frequent testing and hiv prep to  persons at increased risk for hiv infection followup patients should be reexamined 3–7 days after therapy  initiation if treatment is successful ulcers usually improve  symptomatically within 3 days and objectively within 7 days  after therapy if no clinical improvement is evident the clinician  should consider whether the diagnosis is correct another sti  is present the patient has hiv infection the treatment was  not used as instructed or the h ducreyi strain causing the  infection is resistant to the prescribed antimicrobial the time  required for complete healing depends on the size of the ulcer  large ulcers might require 2 weeks in addition healing can  be slower for uncircumcised men who have ulcers under the  foreskin clinical resolution of fluctuant lymphadenopathy is  slower than that of ulcers and might require needle aspiration  or incision and drainage despite otherwise successful therapy  although needle aspiration of buboes is a simpler procedure  incision and drainage might be preferred because of reduced  need for subsequent drainage procedures management of sex partners regardless of whether disease symptoms are present sex  partners of patients with chancroid should be examined and  treated if they had sexual contact with the patient during the  10 days preceding the patient’s symptom onset special considerations pregnancy data indicate ciprofloxacin presents a low risk to the  fetus during pregnancy but has potential for toxicity during  breastfeeding 431 alternative drugs should be used if the  patient is pregnant or lactating no adverse effects of chancroid  on pregnancy outcome have been reported hiv infection persons with hiv infection who have chancroid infection  should be monitored closely because they are more likely to  experience chancroid treatment failure and to have ulcers  that heal slowly 430432 persons with hiv might require  repeated or longer courses of therapy and treatment failures  can occur with any regimen data are limited concerning  the therapeutic efficacy of the recommended singledose  azithromycin and ceftriaxone regimens among persons with  hiv infection children because sexual contact is the major primary transmission route  among us patients diagnosis of chancroid ulcers among infants  and children especially in the genital or perineal region is highly  suspicious of sexual abuse however h ducreyi is recognized as a  major cause of nonsexually transmitted cutaneous ulcers among  children in tropical regions and specifically countries where  yaws is endemic 433–435 acquisition of a lowerextremity  ulcer attributable to h ducreyi in a child without genital ulcers  and reported travel to a region where yaws is endemic should  not be considered evidence of sexual abuse genital herpes  genital herpes is a chronic lifelong viral infection two types  of hsv can cause genital herpes hsv1 and hsv2 most  cases of recurrent genital herpes are caused by hsv2 and  119 of persons aged 14–49 years are estimated to be infected  in the united states 436 however an increasing proportion  of anogenital herpetic infections have been attributed to  hsv1 which is especially prominent among young women  and msm 186437438 the majority of persons infected with hsv2 have not  had the condition diagnosed many of whom have mild or  unrecognized infections but shed virus intermittently in the  anogenital area consequently most genital herpes infections  are transmitted by persons unaware that they have the  infection or who are asymptomatic when transmission occurs  management of genital hsv should address the chronic nature  of the infection rather than focusing solely on treating acute  episodes of genital lesions recommendations and reports 30 mmwr  july 23 2021  vol 70  no 4 us department of health and human servicescenters for disease control and prevention diagnostic considerations clinical diagnosis of genital herpes can be difficult because the  selflimited recurrent painful and vesicular or ulcerative lesions  classically associated with hsv are absent in many infected persons  at the time of clinical evaluation if genital lesions are present  clinical diagnosis of genital herpes should be confirmed by type specific virologic testing from the lesion by naat or culture 186  recurrences and subclinical shedding are much more frequent for  hsv2 genital herpes infection than for hsv1 genital herpes  439440 therefore prognosis and counseling depend on which  hsv type is present typespecific serologic tests can be used to  aid in the diagnosis of hsv infection in the absence of genital  lesions both typespecific virologic and typespecific serologic tests  for hsv should be available in clinical settings that provide care  to persons with or at risk for stis hsv2 genital herpes infection  increases the risk for acquiring hiv twofold to threefold therefore  all persons with genital herpes should be tested for hiv 441 virologic tests hsv naat assays are the most sensitive tests because  they detect hsv from genital ulcers or other mucocutaneous  lesions these tests are increasingly available 442–444  although multiple fdacleared assays exist for hsv detection  these tests vary in sensitivity from 909 to 100 however  they are considered highly specific 445–447 pcr is also  the test of choice for diagnosing hsv infections affecting the  central nervous system cns and systemic infections eg  meningitis encephalitis and neonatal herpes hsv pcr  of the blood should not be performed to diagnose genital  herpes infection except in cases in which concern exists for  disseminated infection eg hepatitis in certain settings viral  culture is the only available virologic test the sensitivity of viral  culture is low especially for recurrent lesions and decreases  rapidly as lesions begin to heal 443448 viral culture  isolates and pcr amplicons should be typed to determine  whether hsv1 or hsv2 is causing the infection failure to  detect hsv by naat or culture especially in the presence  of older lesions or the absence of active lesions does not  indicate an absence of hsv infection because viral shedding  is intermittent similarly random or blind genital swabs in  the absence of lesions should not be used to diagnose genital  hsv infection because sensitivity is low and a negative result  does not exclude the presence of hsv infection cytologic detection of cellular changes associated with hsv  infection is an insensitive and nonspecific method of diagnosing  genital lesions ie tzanck preparation and therefore should  not be relied on although a direct immunofluorescence  assay using fluoresceinlabeled monoclonal antibodies is also  available for detecting hsv antigen from genital specimens  this assay lacks sensitivity and is not recommended 449 typespecific serologic tests both typespecific and typecommon antibodies to hsv  develop during the first weeks after infection and persist  indefinitely the majority of available accurate type specific hsv serologic assays are based on the hsvspecific  glycoprotein g2 gg2 hsv2 and glycoprotein g1 gg1  hsv1 typecommon antibody tests do not distinguish  between hsv1 and hsv2 infection therefore typespecific  serologic assays should be requested 450–452 both laboratorybased assays and poc tests that provide  results for hsv2 antibodies from capillary blood or serum  during a clinic visit are available the sensitivity of glycoprotein  g typespecific tests for detecting hsv2 antibody varies from  80 to 98 falsenegative results might be more frequent  at early stages of infection 451453454 therefore in  cases of recent suspected hsv2 acquisition repeat type specific antibody testing 12 weeks after the presumed time  of acquisition is indicated the most commonly used test  herpeselect hsv2 enzyme immunoassay eia often is  falsely positive at low index values 11–30 457–457 one  study reported an overall specificity of 574 with a specificity  of 398 for index values of 11–29 458 because of the  poor specificity of commercially available typespecific eias  particularly with low index values 30 a confirmatory test  biokit or western blot with a second method should be  performed before test interpretation use of confirmatory  testing with the biokit or the western blot assays have been  reported to improve accuracy of hsv2 serologic testing 459  the herpeselect hsv2 immunoblot should not be used for  confirmation because it uses the same antigen as the hsv2  eia if confirmatory tests are unavailable patients should be  counseled about the limitations of available testing before  obtaining serologic tests and health care providers should  be aware that falsepositive results occur immunoglobulin  m igm testing for hsv1 or hsv2 is not useful because  igm tests are not type specific and might be positive during  recurrent genital or oral episodes of herpes 460 therefore  hsv igm testing is not recommended because approximately all hsv2 infections are sexually  acquired presence of typespecific hsv2 antibody implies  anogenital infection in this instance education and counseling  for persons with genital hsv infections should be provided  the presence of hsv1 antibody alone is more difficult  to interpret hsv1 serologic testing does not distinguish  between oral and genital infection and typically should not  be performed for diagnosing genital hsv1 infection persons  with hsv1 antibodies often have oral hsv infection acquired  during childhood which might be asymptomatic lack of  symptoms in a person who is hsv1 seropositive does

clinical diagnosis of genital herpes  without laboratory confirmation and a patient’s partner has  genital herpes hsv2 serologic screening among the general  population is not recommended patients who are at higher  risk for infection eg those presenting for an sti evaluation  especially for persons with ≥10 lifetime sex partners and  persons with hiv infection might need to be assessed for a  history of genital herpes symptoms followed by typespecific  hsv serologic assays to diagnose genital herpes for those with  genital symptoms genital herpes management antiviral medication offers clinical benefits to symptomatic  patients and is the mainstay of management the goals for  use of antiviral medications to treat genital herpes infection  are to treat or prevent symptomatic genital herpes recurrences  and improve quality of life and suppress the virus to prevent  transmission to sexual partners counseling regarding the  natural history of genital herpes risks for sexual and perinatal  transmission and methods for reducing transmission is also  integral to clinical management systemic antiviral drugs can partially control the signs and  symptoms of genital herpes when used to treat first clinical and  recurrent episodes or when used as daily suppressive therapy  however these drugs neither eradicate latent virus nor affect  the risk frequency or severity of recurrences after the drug  is discontinued randomized trials have indicated that three  fdaapproved antiviral medications provide clinical benefit  for genital herpes acyclovir valacyclovir and famciclovir  463–471 valacyclovir is the valine ester of acyclovir and has  enhanced absorption after oral administration allowing for  less frequent dosing than acyclovir famciclovir also has high  oral bioavailability topical therapy with antiviral drugs offers  minimal clinical benefit and is discouraged first clinical episode of genital herpes newly acquired genital herpes can cause a prolonged  clinical illness with severe genital ulcerations and neurologic  involvement even persons with firstepisode herpes who have  mild clinical manifestations initially can experience severe or  prolonged symptoms during recurrent infection therefore  all patients with first episodes of genital herpes should receive  antiviral therapy recommended regimens for first clinical episode of genital  herpes acyclovir† 400 mg orally 3 timesday for 7–10 days or famciclovir 250 mg orally 3 timesday for 7–10 days or valacyclovir 1 g orally 2 timesday for 7–10 days  treatment can be extended if healing is incomplete after 10 days of therapy † acyclovir 200 mg orally 5 timesday is also effective but is not  recommended because of the frequency of dosing recurrent hsv2 genital herpes almost all persons with symptomatic firstepisode hsv2  genital herpes subsequently experience recurrent episodes of  genital lesions intermittent asymptomatic shedding occurs  among persons with hsv2 genital herpes infection even  those with longstanding clinically silent infection antiviral  therapy for recurrent genital herpes can be administered either  as suppressive therapy to reduce the frequency of recurrences  or episodically to ameliorate or shorten the duration of lesions  certain persons including those with mild or infrequent  recurrent outbreaks benefit from antiviral therapy therefore  options for treatment should be discussed many persons prefer  suppressive therapy which has the additional advantage of  decreasing the risk for transmitting hsv2 genital herpes to  susceptible partners 472473 suppressive therapy for recurrent hsv2  genital herpes suppressive therapy reduces frequency of genital herpes  recurrences by 70–80 among patients who have frequent  recurrences 469–472 persons receiving such therapy  often report having experienced no symptomatic outbreaks  suppressive therapy also is effective for patients with less  frequent recurrences longterm safety and efficacy have  been documented among patients receiving daily acyclovir  valacyclovir and famciclovir 474 quality of life is improved  for many patients with frequent recurrences who receive  suppressive therapy rather than episodic treatment 475  providers should discuss with patients on an annual basis  whether they want to continue suppressive therapy because  frequency of genital hsv2 recurrence diminishes over time  for many persons however neither treatment discontinuation  nor laboratory monitoring is necessary because adverse events  and development of hsv antiviral resistance related to long term antiviral use are uncommon recommendations and reports 32 mmwr  july 23 2021  vol 70  no 4 us department of health and human servicescenters for disease control and prevention treatment with valacyclovir 500 mg daily decreases the rate  of hsv2 transmission for discordant heterosexual couples  in which a partner has a history of genital hsv2 infection  473 such couples should be encouraged to consider  suppressive antiviral therapy as part of a strategy for preventing  transmission in addition to consistent condom use and  avoidance of sexual activity during recurrences suppressive  antiviral therapy for persons with a history of symptomatic  genital herpes also is likely to reduce transmission when used  by those who have multiple partners hsv2

no data are available regarding the efficacy  of suppressive therapy for preventing transmission among  persons with hsv1 genital herpes infection because of  the decreased risk for recurrences and shedding suppressive  therapy for hsv1 genital herpes should be reserved for those  with frequent recurrences through shared clinical decision making between the patient and the provider episodic therapy for recurrent hsv2 genital herpes episodic treatment of recurrent herpes is most effective if  therapy is initiated within 1 day of lesion onset or during the  prodrome that precedes some outbreaks the patient should  be provided with a supply of drug or a prescription for the  medication with instructions to initiate treatment immediately  when symptoms begin acyclovir famciclovir and

therapy were less likely to experience  acyclovirresistant hsv infection compared with those who  received episodic therapy for outbreaks 513 genital herpes during pregnancy prevention of neonatal herpes depends both on preventing  acquisition of genital herpes during late pregnancy and  avoiding exposure of the neonate to herpetic lesions and viral  shedding during delivery mothers of newborns who acquire  neonatal herpes often lack histories of clinically evident genital  herpes 514515 the risk for transmission to the neonate from  an infected mother is high 30–50 among women who  acquire genital herpes near the time of delivery and low 1  among women with prenatal histories of recurrent herpes or  who acquire genital herpes during the first half of pregnancy  516517 women who acquire

of genital herpes or genital symptoms concerning  for hsv infection at the onset of labor all women should  be questioned thoroughly about symptoms of genital herpes  including prodromal symptoms eg pain or burning at site  before appearance of lesion and all women should be examined  thoroughly for herpetic lesions women without symptoms or  signs of genital herpes or its prodrome can deliver vaginally  although cesarean delivery does not eliminate the risk for hsv  transmission to the neonate 517 women with recurrent genital  herpetic lesions at the onset of labor should have a cesarean  delivery to reduce the risk for neonatal hsv infection routine hsv2 serologic screening of pregnant women is not  recommended women without known genital herpes should  be counseled to abstain from

genital ulcerative  disease caused by the intracellular gramnegative bacterium  klebsiella granulomatis formerly known as calymmatobacterium  granulomatis the disease occurs rarely in the united states  however sporadic cases have been described in india south  africa and south america 526–535 although granuloma  inguinale was previously endemic in australia it is now  extremely rare 536537 clinically the disease is characterized  as painless slowly progressive ulcerative lesions on the genitals  or perineum without regional lymphadenopathy subcutaneous  granulomas pseudobuboes also might occur the lesions  are highly vascular ie beefy red appearance and can bleed  extragenital infection can occur with infection extension to  the pelvis or it can disseminate to intraabdominal organs  bones or the mouth the lesions also can develop secondary  bacterial infection and can coexist with other sexually  transmitted pathogens diagnostic considerations the causative organism of granuloma inguinale is difficult  to culture and diagnosis requires visualization of darkstaining  donovan bodies on tissue crush preparation or biopsy  although no fdacleared molecular tests for the detection of  k granulomatis dna exist molecular assays might be useful  for identifying the causative agent treatment multiple antimicrobial regimens have been effective  however only a limited number of controlled trials have  been published 538 treatment has been reported to halt  progression of lesions and healing typically proceeds inward  from the ulcer margins prolonged therapy is

invasive  infection in contrast with c trachomatis serovars a–k that  cause mild or asymptomatic infection clinical manifestations  of lgv can include gud lymphadenopathy or proctocolitis  rectal exposure among msm or women can result in  proctocolitis which is the most common presentation of  lgv infection 541 and can mimic inflammatory bowel  disease with clinical findings of mucoid or hemorrhagic  rectal discharge anal pain constipation fever or tenesmus  542543 outbreaks of lgv proctocolitis have been  reported among msm with high rates of hiv infection  544–547 lgv proctocolitis can be an invasive systemic  infection and if it is not treated early can lead to chronic  colorectal fistulas and strictures reactive arthropathy has also  been reported however reports indicate that rectal lgv can  also be asymptomatic 548 a common clinical manifestation  of lgv among heterosexuals is tender inguinal or femoral  lymphadenopathy that is typically unilateral a selflimited  genital ulcer or papule sometimes occurs at the site of inoculation  however by the time persons seek care the lesions have often  disappeared lgvassociated lymphadenopathy can be severe  with bubo formation from fluctuant or suppurative inguinal or  femoral lymphadenopathy oral ulceration can occur and might  be associated with cervical adenopathy 549–551 persons with  genital or colorectal lgv lesions can also experience secondary  bacterial infection or can be infected with other sexually and  nonsexually transmitted pathogens diagnostic considerations a definitive lgv diagnosis can be made only with lgv specific molecular testing eg pcrbased genotyping these  tests can differentiate lgv from non–lgv c trachomatis in  rectal specimens however these tests are not widely available  and results are not typically available in a time frame that  would influence clinical management therefore diagnosis is  based on clinical suspicion epidemiologic information and a  c trachomatis naat at the symptomatic anatomic site along  with exclusion of other etiologies for proctocolitis inguinal  lymphadenopathy or genital oral or rectal ulcers 551552  genital or oral lesions rectal specimens and lymph node  specimens ie lesion swab or bubo aspirate can be tested  for c trachomatis by naat or culture naat is the preferred  approach for testing because it can detect both lgv strains and  non–lgv c trachomatis strains 553 therefore all persons  presenting with proctocolitis should be tested for chlamydia  with a naat performed on rectal specimens severe symptoms  of proctocolitis eg

not be used routinely as a  diagnostic tool for lgv because the utility of these serologic  methods has not been established interpretation has not been  standardized and validation for clinical proctitis presentation  has not been done it might support an lgv diagnosis in  cases of isolated inguinal or femoral lymphadenopathy for  which diagnostic material for c trachomatis naat cannot  be obtained treatment at the time of the initial visit before diagnostic naats  for chlamydia are available persons with a clinical syndrome  consistent with lgv should be presumptively treated  presumptive treatment for lgv is indicated among patients  with symptoms or signs of proctocolitis eg bloody  discharge tenesmus or ulceration in cases of severe inguinal  lymphadenopathy with bubo formation particularly if the  patient has a recent history of a genital ulcer or in the presence  of a genital ulcer if other etiologies have been ruled out the  goal of treatment is to cure infection and prevent ongoing tissue  damage although tissue reaction to the infection can result in  scarring buboes might require aspiration through intact skin  or incision and drainage to prevent formation of inguinal or  femoral ulcerations recommended regimen for lymphogranuloma venereum doxycycline 100 mg orally 2 timesday for 21 days alternative regimens azithromycin 1 g orally once weekly for 3 weeks or erythromycin base 500 mg orally 4 timesday for 21 days  because this regimen has not been validated a test of cure with c trachomatis  naat 4 weeks after completion of treatment can be considered the optimal treatment duration for symptomatic lgv has  not been studied in clinical trials the recommended 21day  course of doxycycline is based on longstanding clinical practice  and is highly effective with an estimated cure rate of 985  555556 shorter courses of doxycycline might be effective  on the basis of a small retrospective study of msm with rectal  lgv 50 of whom were symptomatic who received a 7 to  14day course of doxycycline and had a 97 cure rate 558  randomized prospective studies of shortercourse doxycycline  for treating lgv are needed longer courses of therapy might  be required in the setting of fistulas buboes and other forms  of severe disease 559 a small nonrandomized study from spain involving patients  with rectal lgv demonstrated cure rates of 97 with a  regimen of azithromycin 1 g once weekly for 3 weeks 560  pharmacokinetic data support this dosing strategy 561  however this regimen has not been validated fluoroquinolone based treatments also might be effective however the optimal  duration of treatment has not been evaluated the clinical  significance of asymptomatic lgv is unknown and it is  effectively treated with a 7day course of doxycycline 562  other management considerations patients should be followed clinically until signs and  symptoms have resolved persons who receive an lgv diagnosis  should be tested for other stis especially hiv gonorrhea and  syphilis those whose hiv test results are negative should be  offered hiv prep followup all persons who have been treated for lgv should be retested  for chlamydia approximately 3 months after treatment if  retesting at 3 months is not possible providers should retest  at the patient’s next visit for medical care within the 12month  period after initial treatment management of sex partners persons who have had sexual contact with a patient who  has lgv within the 60 days before onset of the patient’s  symptoms should be evaluated examined and

servicescenters for disease control and prevention hiv infection persons with lgv and hiv infection should receive the  same regimens as those who do not have hiv prolonged  therapy might be required because a delay in resolution of  symptoms might occur syphilis syphilis is a systemic disease caused by t pallidum the  disease has been divided into stages on the basis of clinical  findings which guide treatment and followup persons who  have syphilis might seek treatment for signs or symptoms  primary syphilis classically presents as a single painless ulcer  or chancre at the site of infection but can also present with  multiple atypical or painful lesions 564 secondary syphilis  manifestations can include skin rash mucocutaneous lesions  and lymphadenopathy tertiary syphilis can present with  cardiac involvement gummatous lesions tabes dorsalis and  general paresis latent infections ie those lacking clinical manifestations  are detected by serologic testing latent syphilis acquired  within the preceding year is referred to as early latent syphilis  all other cases of latent syphilis are classified as late latent  syphilis or latent syphilis of unknown duration t pallidum can infect the cns which can occur at any stage  of syphilis and result in neurosyphilis early neurologic clinical  manifestations or syphilitic meningitis eg cranial nerve  dysfunction meningitis meningovascular syphilis stroke  and acute altered mental status are usually present within  the first few months or years of infection late neurologic  manifestations eg tabes dorsalis and general paresis occur  10 to 30 years after infection infection of the visual system ocular syphilis or auditory  system otosyphilis can occur at any stage of syphilis but is  commonly identified during the early stages and can present  with or without additional cns involvement ocular syphilis  often presents as panuveitis but can involve structures in  both the anterior and posterior segment of the eye including  conjunctivitis anterior uveitis posterior interstitial keratitis  optic neuropathy and retinal vasculitis ocular syphilis can  result in permanent vision loss otosyphilis typically presents  with cochleovestibular symptoms including tinnitus vertigo  and sensorineural hearing loss hearing loss can be unilateral or  bilateral have a sudden onset and progress rapidly otosyphilis  can result in permanent hearing loss diagnostic considerations darkfield examinations and molecular tests for detecting  t pallidum directly from lesion exudate or tissue are  the definitive methods for diagnosing early syphilis and  congenital syphilis 565 although no t pallidum direct detection molecular naats are commercially available  certain laboratories provide locally developed and validated  pcr tests for detecting t pallidum dna a presumptive  diagnosis of syphilis requires use of two laboratory serologic  tests a nontreponemal test ie venereal disease research  laboratory vdrl or rapid plasma reagin rpr test  and a treponemal test ie the t pallidum passive particle  agglutination tppa assay various eias chemiluminescence  immunoassays cias and immunoblots or rapid treponemal  assays 566–568 at least 18 treponemalspecific tests are  cleared for use in the united states use of only one type of  serologic test nontreponemal or treponemal is insufficient  for diagnosis and can result in falsenegative results among  persons tested during primary syphilis and falsepositive results  among persons without syphilis or previously treated syphilis nontreponemal tests and traditional algorithm falsepositive nontreponemal test results can be associated  with multiple medical conditions and factors unrelated to  syphilis including other infections eg hiv autoimmune  conditions vaccinations injecting drug use pregnancy  and older age 566569 therefore persons with a reactive  nontreponemal test should always receive a treponemal test  to confirm the syphilis diagnosis ie traditional algorithm  nontreponemal test antibody titers might correlate with disease  activity and are used for monitoring treatment response serum  should be diluted to identify the highest titer and results should  be reported quantitatively a fourfold change in titer equivalent  to a change of two dilutions eg from 116 to 14 or from 18  to 132 is considered necessary for demonstrating a clinically  significant difference between two nontreponemal test results  obtained by using the same serologic test preferably from the  same manufacturer to avoid variation in results sequential  serologic tests for a patient should be performed using the  same testing method vdrl or rpr preferably by the same  laboratory vdrl and rpr are equally valid assays however  quantitative results from the two tests cannot be compared  directly with each other because the methods are different  and rpr titers frequently are slightly higher than vdrl titers nontreponemal test titers usually decrease after treatment  and might become nonreactive with time however for certain  persons nontreponemal antibodies might decrease less than  fourfold after treatment ie inadequate serologic response  or might decline appropriately but fail to serorevert and  recommendations and reports 40 mmwr  july 23 2021  vol 70  no 4 us department of health and human servicescenters for disease control and prevention persist for a long period atypical nontreponemal serologic  test results eg unusually high unusually low or fluctuating  titers might occur regardless of hiv status when serologic  tests do not correspond with clinical findings indicative of  primary secondary or latent syphilis presumptive treatment is  recommended for persons with risk factors for syphilis and use  of other tests eg biopsy for histology and immunostaining  and pcr of lesion should be considered for the majority  of persons with hiv infection serologic tests are accurate  and reliable for diagnosing syphilis and evaluating response  to treatment treponemal tests and reverse  sequence algorithm the majority of patients who have reactive treponemal tests  will have reactive tests for the remainder of their lives regardless  of adequate treatment or disease activity however 15–25  of patients treated during the primary stage revert to being  serologically nonreactive after 2–3 years 570 treponemal  antibody titers do not predict treatment response and therefore  should not be used for this purpose clinical laboratories sometimes screen syphilis serologic  samples by using automated treponemal immunoassays  typically by eia or cia 571–573 this reverse sequence  algorithm for syphilis testing can identify persons previously  treated for syphilis those with untreated or incompletely  treated syphilis and those with falsepositive results that can  occur with a low likelihood of infection 574 persons with  a positive treponemal screening test should have a standard  quantitative nontreponemal test with titer performed  reflexively by the laboratory to guide patient management  decisions if the nontreponemal test is negative the laboratory  should perform a treponemal test different from the one used  for initial testing preferably tppa or treponemal assay based  on different antigens than the original test to adjudicate the  results of the initial test if a second treponemal test is positive eg eia reactive  rpr nonreactive or tppa reactive persons with a history  of previous treatment will require no further management  unless sexual history indicates a reexposure in this instance a  repeat nontreponemal test 2–4 weeks after a confirmed medical  history and physical examination is recommended to evaluate  for early infection those without a history of treatment for  syphilis should be offered treatment unless a medical history  or results of a physical examination indicate a recent infection  previously untreated persons should be treated for syphilis of  unknown duration or late latent syphilis if the second treponemal test is negative eg eia reactive  rpr nonreactive tppa nonreactive and the epidemiologic  risk and clinical probability for syphilis are low further  evaluation or treatment is not indicated multiple studies demonstrate that high quantitative index  values or high signaltocutoff ratio from treponemal eia  or cia tests correlate with tppa positivity which might  eliminate the need for additional confirmatory testing  however the range of index values varies among different  treponemal immunoassays and the values that correspond to  high levels of reactivity with confirmatory testing might differ  by immunoassay 567575–582 cerebrospinal fluid evaluation further testing with csf evaluation is warranted for  persons with clinical signs of neurosyphilis eg cranial nerve  dysfunction meningitis stroke acute or chronic altered mental  status or loss of vibration sense all patients with ocular  symptoms and reactive syphilis serology need a full ocular  examination including cranial nerve evaluation if cranial nerve  dysfunction is present a csf evaluation is needed among  persons with isolated ocular symptoms ie no cranial nerve  dysfunction or other neurologic abnormalities confirmed  ocular abnormalities on examination and reactive syphilis  serology a csf examination is unnecessary before treatment  csf analysis can be helpful in evaluating persons with ocular  symptoms and reactive syphilis serology who do not have ocular  findings or cranial nerve dysfunction on examination among  patients with isolated auditory abnormalities and reactive  syphilis serology csf evaluation is likely to be normal and is  unnecessary before treatment 583584 laboratory testing is helpful in supporting the diagnosis of  neurosyphilis however no single test can be used to diagnose  neurosyphilis in all instances diagnosis of neurosyphilis  depends on a combination of csf tests eg csf cell count  protein or reactive csfvdrl in the presence of reactive  serologic test nontreponemal and treponemal results and  neurologic signs and symptoms csf laboratory abnormalities  are common for persons with early syphilis and are of  unknown medical significance in the absence of neurologic  signs or symptoms 585 csfvdrl is highly specific but  insensitive for a person with neurologic signs or symptoms a  reactive csfvdrl in the absence of blood contamination  is considered diagnostic of neurosyphilis when csfvdrl is negative despite clinical signs of  neurosyphilis reactive serologic tests results lymphocytic  pleocytosis or protein neurosyphilis should be considered  in that instance additional evaluation by using fluorescent  treponemalantibody absorption ftaabs or tppa testing  on csf might be warranted the csf ftaabs test is less  specific for neurosyphilis than the csfvdrl but is highly  sensitive fewer data are available regarding csf tppa  recommendations and reports mmwr  july 23 2021  vol 70  no 4 41us department of health and human servicescenters for disease control and prevention however the sensitivity and specificity appear similar to the  csf ftaabs 586 neurosyphilis is highly unlikely with  a negative csf ftaabs or tppa test especially among  persons with nonspecific neurologic signs and symptoms 587 among persons with hiv infection csf leukocyte count  can be elevated 5 wbcsmm3 the association with csf  leukocyte count and plasma hiv viral suppression has not been  well characterized using a higher cutoff 20 wbcsmm3  might improve the specificity of neurosyphilis diagnosis among  this population 588 treatment penicillin g administered parenterally is the preferred drug  for treating patients in all stages of syphilis the preparation  used ie benzathine aqueous procaine or aqueous  crystalline dosage and length of treatment depend on the  stage and clinical manifestations of the disease treatment for  late latent syphilis 1 years’ duration and tertiary syphilis  requires a longer duration of therapy because organisms  theoretically might be dividing more slowly the validity of this  rationale has not been assessed longer treatment duration is  required for persons with latent syphilis of unknown duration  to ensure that those who did not acquire syphilis within the  preceding year are adequately treated selection of the appropriate penicillin preparation is  important because t pallidum can reside in sequestered sites  eg the cns and aqueous humor that are poorly accessed  by certain forms of penicillin combinations of benzathine  penicillin procaine penicillin and oral penicillin preparations  are not considered appropriate for syphilis treatment reports  have indicated that practitioners have inadvertently prescribed  combination long and shortacting benzathineprocaine  penicillin bicillin cr instead of the standard benzathine  penicillin product bicillin la recommended in the united  states for treating primary secondary and latent syphilis  practitioners pharmacists and purchasing agents should be  aware of the similar names of these two products to avoid  using the incorrect combination therapy agent for treating  syphilis 589 penicillin’s effectiveness for treating syphilis was well  established through clinical experience even before the value of  randomized controlled clinical trials was recognized therefore  approximately all recommendations for treating syphilis are  based not only on clinical trials and observational studies but  on many decades of clinical experience special considerations pregnancy parenteral penicillin g is the only therapy with documented  efficacy for syphilis during pregnancy pregnant women with  syphilis at any stage who report penicillin allergy should be  desensitized and treated with penicillin see management of  persons who have a history of penicillin allergy jarischherxheimer reaction the jarischherxheimer reaction is an acute febrile reaction  frequently accompanied by headache myalgia and fever that  can occur within the first 24 hours after the initiation of any  syphilis therapy it is a reaction to treatment and not an allergic  reaction to penicillin patients should be informed about this  possible adverse reaction and how to manage it if it occurs the  jarischherxheimer reaction occurs most frequently among  persons who have early syphilis presumably because bacterial  loads are higher during these stages antipyretics can be used  to manage symptoms however they have not been proven to  prevent this reaction the jarischherxheimer reaction might  induce early labor or cause fetal distress in pregnant women  however this should not prevent or delay therapy 590 see  syphilis during pregnancy management of sex partners sexual transmission of t pallidum is thought to occur only  when mucocutaneous syphilitic lesions are present such  manifestations are uncommon after the first year of infection  persons exposed through sexual contact with a person who  has primary secondary or early latent syphilis should be  evaluated clinically and serologically and treated according to  the following recommendations • persons who have had sexual contact with a person who  receives a diagnosis of primary secondary or early latent  syphilis 90 days before the diagnosis should be treated  presumptively for early syphilis even if serologic test results  are negative • persons who have had sexual contact with a person who  receives a diagnosis of primary secondary or early latent  syphilis 90 days before the diagnosis should be treated  presumptively for early syphilis if serologic test results are  not immediately available and the opportunity for  followup is uncertain if serologic tests are negative no  treatment is needed if serologic tests are positive  treatment should be based on clinical and serologic  evaluation and

partners of persons who have late latent  syphilis should be evaluated clinically and serologically for  syphilis and treated on the basis of the evaluation’s findings • the following sex partners of persons with syphilis are  considered at risk for infection and should be confidentially  notified of the exposure and need for evaluation partners  who have had sexual contact within 3 months plus the  duration of symptoms for persons who receive a diagnosis  of primary syphilis within 6 months plus duration of  symptoms for those with secondary syphilis and within  1 year for persons with early latent syphilis primary and secondary syphilis treatment parenteral penicillin g has been used effectively for achieving  clinical resolution ie the healing of lesions and prevention of  sexual transmission and for preventing late sequelae however  no comparative trials have been conducted to guide selection  of an optimal penicillin regimen substantially fewer data are  available for

infants and children aged  ≥1 month with primary and secondary syphilis should be  managed by a pediatric infectious disease specialist and  evaluated for sexual abuse eg through consultation with child  protective services see sexual assault or abuse of children other management considerations all persons who have primary and secondary syphilis should  be tested for hiv at the time of diagnosis and treatment those  persons whose hiv test results are negative should be offered  hiv prep in geographic areas in which hiv prevalence is  high persons who have primary or secondary syphilis should  be offered prep and retested for hiv in 3 months if the initial  hiv test result was negative persons who have syphilis and symptoms or signs indicating  neurologic disease eg cranial nerve dysfunction meningitis  stroke or altered mental state should have an evaluation  that includes csf analysis persons with syphilis who have  symptoms or signs of ocular syphilis eg uveitis iritis  neuroretinitis or optic neuritis should have a thorough cranial  nerve examination and ocular slitlamp and ophthalmologic  examinations csf evaluation is not always needed for persons  with ocular syphilis if no evidence of cranial nerves 2 3 4  5 and 6 dysfunction or other evidence of neurologic disease  exists if symptoms and signs of otic syphilis are present then  an otologic examination is needed csf evaluation in persons  with otic syphilis does not aid in the clinical management  and therefore is not recommended see cerebrospinal fluid  evaluation treatment should be guided by the results of these  evaluations invasion of csf by t pallidum accompanied  by csf laboratory abnormalities is common among adults  who have primary or secondary syphilis but has unknown  medical significance 585 in the absence of clinical  neurologic findings no evidence supports variation from the  recommended treatment regimen for primary or secondary  syphilis symptomatic

latent syphilis of unknown duration or late latent syphilis  1 year’s duration nontreponemal serologic titers usually are  higher early in the course of syphilis infection however early  latent

treated  syphilis should be treated according to the syphilis stage treatment penicillin g is the only known effective antimicrobial for  treating fetal infection and preventing congenital syphilis  639 evidence is insufficient to determine the optimal  penicillin regimen during pregnancy 640 recommended regimen for syphilis during pregnancy pregnant women should be treated with the recommended penicillin  regimen for their stage of infection other management considerations the following recommendations should be considered for  pregnant women with syphilis infection • certain evidence indicates that additional therapy is  beneficial for pregnant women to prevent congenital  syphilis for women who have primary secondary or early  latent syphilis a second dose of benzathine penicillin g  24 million units im can be administered 1 week after the  initial dose 641–643 • when syphilis is diagnosed during the second half of  pregnancy management should include a sonographic fetal  evaluation for congenital syphilis however this evaluation  should not delay therapy sonographic signs of fetal or  placental syphilis eg hepatomegaly ascites hydrops fetal  anemia or a thickened placenta indicate a greater risk for  fetal treatment failure 644 cases accompanied by these  signs should be managed in consultation with obstetric  specialists a second dose of benzathine penicillin g  24 million units im after the initial dose might be beneficial  for fetal treatment in these situations • women treated for syphilis during the second half of  pregnancy are at risk for premature labor or fetal distress  if the treatment precipitates the jarischherxheimer  reaction 590 these women should be advised to seek  obstetric attention after treatment if they notice any fever  contractions or decrease in fetal movements stillbirth is  a rare complication of treatment however concern for  this complication should not delay necessary treatment  no data are available to support that corticosteroid  treatment alters the risk for treatmentrelated complications  during pregnancy • missed doses 9 days between doses are not acceptable for  pregnant women receiving therapy for late latent syphilis  613 an optimal interval between doses is 7 days for  pregnant women if a pregnant woman does not return  for the next dose on day 7 every effort should be made  recommendations and reports mmwr  july 23 2021  vol 70  no 4 51us department of health and human servicescenters for disease control and prevention to contact her and link her to immediate treatment within  2 days to avoid retreatment pregnant women who miss a  dose of therapy should repeat the full course of therapy • all women who have syphilis should be offered testing for  hiv at the time of diagnosis followup coordinated prenatal care and treatment are vital because  providers should document that women are adequately  treated for the syphilis stage and ensure that the clinical and  antibody responses are appropriate for the patient’s disease  stage if syphilis is diagnosed and treated at or before 24 weeks’  gestation serologic titers should not be repeated before 8 weeks  after treatment eg at 32 weeks’ gestation but should be  repeated again at delivery titers should be repeated sooner  if reinfection or treatment failure is suspected for syphilis  diagnosed and treated after 24 weeks’ gestation serologic titers  should be repeated at delivery a majority of women will not achieve a fourfold decrease  in titers before delivery although this does not indicate  treatment failure 645 however a fourfold increase in titer  after treatment eg from 18 to 132 that is sustained for  2 weeks is concerning for reinfection or treatment failure  nontreponemal titers can increase immediately after treatment  presumably related to the treatment response therefore unless  symptoms and signs exist of primary or secondary syphilis  followup titer should not be repeated until approximately  8 weeks after treatment inadequate maternal treatment is  likely if delivery occurs within 30 days of therapy clinical signs  of infection are present at delivery or the maternal antibody  titer at delivery is fourfold higher than the pretreatment titer management of sex partners see syphilis management of sex partners special considerations penicillin allergy no proven alternatives to penicillin are available for  treatment of syphilis during pregnancy pregnant women who  have a history of penicillin allergy should be desensitized and  treated with penicillin g skin testing or oral graded penicillin  dose challenge might be helpful in identifying women at risk  for acute allergic reactions see management of persons who  have a history of penicillin allergy tetracycline and doxycycline are to be avoided in the second  and third trimesters of pregnancy 431 erythromycin and  azithromycin should not be used because neither reliably cures  maternal infection nor treats an infected fetus 640 data are  insufficient to recommend ceftriaxone or other cephalosporins  for treatment of maternal infection and prevention of  congenital syphilis 646647 hiv infection placental inflammation from congenital syphilis infection  might increase the risk for perinatal transmission of hiv all  women with hiv infection should be evaluated for syphilis and  receive a penicillin regimen appropriate for the syphilis stage  data are insufficient to recommend any alternative regimens  for pregnant women with syphilis and hiv infection see  syphilis among persons with hiv congenital syphilis the rate of reported congenital syphilis in the united states  has increased dramatically since 2012 during 2019 a total of  1870 cases of congenital syphilis were reported including 94  stillbirths and 34 infant deaths 141 the 2019 national rate  of 485 cases per 100000 live births represents a 41 increase  relative to 2018 343 cases per 100000 live births and a 477  increase relative to 2012 84 cases per 100000 live births  during 2015–2019 the rate of congenital syphilis increased  2911 124 to 485 per 100000 live births which mirrors  increases in the rate of primary and secondary syphilis among  females aged 15–44 years a 1719 increase from 32 to 87  per 100000 females effective prevention and detection of congenital syphilis  depend on identifying syphilis among pregnant women and  therefore on the routine serologic screening of pregnant  women during the first prenatal visit and at 28 weeks’ gestation  and at delivery for women who live in communities with high  rates of syphilis women with hiv infection or those who  are at increased risk for syphilis acquisition certain states  have recommended screening three times during pregnancy  for all women clinicians should screen according to their  state’s guidelines maternal risk factors for syphilis during pregnancy include  sex with multiple partners sex in conjunction with drug  use or transactional sex late entry to prenatal care ie first  visit during the second trimester or later or no prenatal  care methamphetamine or heroine use incarceration of the  woman or her partner and unstable housing or homelessness  174633–636 moreover as part of the management of  pregnant women who have syphilis providers should obtain  information concerning ongoing risk behaviors and treatment  of sex partners to assess the risk for reinfection routine screening of neonatal sera or umbilical cord blood  is not recommended because diagnosis at that time does not  prevent congenital syphilis in certain newborns no mother  or newborn infant should leave the hospital without maternal  recommendations and reports 52 mmwr  july 23 2021  vol 70  no 4 us department of health and human servicescenters for disease control and prevention serologic status having been documented at least once during  pregnancy any woman who had no prenatal care before  delivery or is considered at increased risk for syphilis acquisition  during pregnancy should have the results of a syphilis serologic  test documented before she or her neonate is discharged a  quantitative rpr is needed at the time of delivery to compare  with the neonate’s nontreponemal test result if a stat rpr  is unavailable and a rapid treponemal test is performed at  delivery the results should be confirmed by using standard  syphilis serologic laboratory tests eg rpr and treponemal  test and algorithms evaluation and treatment of neonates diagnosis of congenital syphilis can be difficult because  maternal nontreponemal and treponemal immunoglobulin g  igg antibodies can be transferred through the placenta to the  fetus complicating the interpretation of reactive serologic tests  for syphilis among neonates infants aged 30 days therefore  treatment decisions frequently must be made on the basis of  identification of syphilis in the mother adequacy of maternal  treatment presence of clinical laboratory or radiographic  evidence of syphilis in the neonate and comparison of maternal  at delivery and neonatal nontreponemal serologic titers eg  rpr or vdrl by using the same test preferably conducted  by the same laboratory any neonate at risk for congenital  syphilis should receive a full evaluation and testing for hiv all neonates born to mothers who have reactive nontreponemal  and treponemal test results should be evaluated with a  quantitative nontreponemal serologic test rpr or vdrl  performed on the neonate’s serum because umbilical cord blood  can become contaminated with maternal blood and yield a  falsepositive result and wharton’s jelly within the umbilical  cord can yield a falsenegative result the nontreponemal  test performed on the neonate should be the same type of  nontreponemal test performed on the mother conducting a treponemal test eg tppa immunoassay eia cia or microbead immunoassay on neonatal serum is  not recommended because it is difficult to interpret as passively  transferred maternal antibodies can persist for 15 months  commercially available igm tests are not recommended all neonates born to women who have reactive nontreponemal  serologic tests for syphilis at delivery should be examined  thoroughly for evidence of congenital syphilis eg nonimmune  hydrops conjugated or direct hyperbilirubinemia† or  cholestatic jaundice or cholestasis hepatosplenomegaly  rhinitis skin rash or pseudoparalysis of an extremity  pathologic examination of the placenta or umbilical cord using  specific staining eg

performed in addition to these tests for stillborn infants  skeletal survey demonstrating typical osseous lesions might aid  in the diagnosis of congenital syphilis because these  abnormalities are not detected on fetal ultrasound the following scenarios describe the recommended  congenital syphilis evaluation and treatment of neonates born  to women who had reactive nontreponemal and treponemal  serologic tests for syphilis during pregnancy eg rpr reactive  tppa reactive or eia reactive rpr reactive and have a  reactive nontreponemal test at delivery eg rpr reactive  maternal history of

allergy able to tolerate  the medication 660 the prevalence of reported penicillin  allergy in lowincome countries is unknown however limited  data indicate that penicillin is one of the most frequently  reported antibiotic allergies 661 patients often are incorrectly labeled as allergic to penicillin  and are therefore denied the benefit of a ßlactam therapy  the presence of a penicillin allergy label considerably reduces  prescribing options for affected patients moreover penicillin  allergy labels lead to the use of more expensive and less effective  drugs and can result in adverse consequences including longer  length of hospital stay and increased risk for infection multiple  studies have described that persons with reported penicillin or  another ßlactam antibiotic allergy have higher rates of surgical site infections methicillinresistant staphylococcus aureus  infections and higher medical care usage 653662–664 the overreported prevalence of penicillin allergy is  secondary to imprecise use of the term “allergy” by families  and clinicians and lack of clarity to differentiate between  immunoglobulin e igemediated hypersensitivity reactions  drug intolerances and other idiosyncratic reactions that can  occur days after exposure approximately 80 of patients  with a true igemediated allergic reaction to penicillin have  lost the sensitivity after 10 years

studies in preoperative  surgical patients with reported penicillin allergy evaluated  for cardiovascular surgery 668 or orthopedics 669 have  rates of skin test positivity 85 however when patients  with highrisk penicillin allergy histories are excluded 99  of patients could receive ßlactams in hospitalized patients  and other populations with comorbidities the typical rates of  validated penicillin allergy among patients who report a history  of penicillin allergy are 25–90 670–673 crossreactivity with cephalosporins penicillin and cephalosporins both contain a ßlactam ring  this structural similarity has led to considerable confusion  regarding crossreactivity of these drugs and the risks for  allergic reactions from cephalosporins among penicillin allergic patients in most clinical settings patients with  reported penicillin allergy are precluded from treatment  with such cephalosporin antibiotics as ceftriaxone third generation cephalosporins eg ceftriaxone and cefixime have  lower crossreactivity with igemediated penicillinallergic  patients 1 compared with first and secondgeneration  cephalosporins range 1–8 moreover anaphylaxis  secondary to cephalosporins is extremely rare among persons  who report a penicillin allergy and is estimated to occur at a rate  of one per 52000 persons 652 data from the kaiser health  care system reported that among 3313 patients with self reported cephalosporin allergy who received a cephalosporin  mostly first generation no cases of anaphylaxis were reported  652 use of third and fourthgeneration

remaining  1–10 of penicillinallergic patients who are not captured  by this penicillin skin test are due to minor determinants ige  antibodies the standard practice is to follow skin testing with  an observed oral challenge of amoxicillin 250 mg with 1 hour  of observation if the skin test and oral challenge are both  negative the risk for igemediated anaphylaxis approaches zero  and is equivalent

subclinical upper genital tract infection asymptomatic infection is common among both men and  women to detect chlamydial infection health care providers  frequently rely on screening tests annual screening of all  sexually active women aged 25 years is recommended as is  screening of older women at increased risk for infection eg  women aged ≥25 years who have a new sex partner more  than one sex partner a sex partner with concurrent partners  or a sex partner who has an sti 149 in a community based cohort of female college students incident chlamydial  infection was also associated with

aged 25 years 141 chlamydia screening programs have been demonstrated  to reduce pid rates among women 786787 although  evidence is insufficient to recommend routine screening for  c trachomatis among sexually active young men because of  certain factors ie feasibility efficacy and costeffectiveness  screening of sexually active young men should be considered  in clinical settings with a high prevalence of chlamydia eg  adolescent clinics correctional facilities or std specialty  recommendations and reports 66 mmwr  july 23 2021  vol 70  no 4 us department of health and human servicescenters for disease control and prevention clinics or for populations with a high burden of infection  eg msm 149788 among women the primary focus of  chlamydia screening should be to detect and treat chlamydia  prevent complications and test and treat their partners  whereas targeted chlamydia screening for men should be  considered only when resources permit prevalence is high and  such screening does not hinder chlamydia screening efforts for  women 789–791 more frequent screening than annual for  certain women eg adolescents or certain men eg msm  might be indicated on the basis of risk behaviors diagnostic considerations for women c trachomatis urogenital infection can be  diagnosed by vaginal or cervical swabs or firstvoid urine for  men c trachomatis urethral infection can be diagnosed by  testing firstvoid urine or a urethral swab naats are the most  sensitive tests for these specimens and are the recommended  test for detecting c trachomatis infection 553 naats that  are fda cleared for use with vaginal swab specimens can be  collected by a clinician or patient in a clinical setting patient collected vaginal swab specimens are equivalent in sensitivity  and specificity to those collected by a clinician using naats  792793 and this screening strategy is highly acceptable  among women 794795 optimal urogenital specimen  types for chlamydia screening by using naat include first catch urine for men and vaginal swabs for women 553  recent studies have demonstrated that among men naat  performance on selfcollected meatal swabs is comparable  to patientcollected urine or providercollected urethral  swabs 796–798 patient collection of a meatal swab for  c trachomatis testing might be a reasonable approach for men  who are either unable to provide urine or prefer to collect their  own meatal swab over providing urine previous evidence  indicates that the liquidbased cytology specimens collected for  pap smears might be acceptable specimens for naat although  test sensitivity using these specimens might be lower than that  associated with use of cervical or vaginal swab specimens 799  regardless certain naats have been cleared by fda for use  on liquidbased cytology specimens rectal and oropharyngeal c trachomatis infection among  persons engaging in receptive anal or oral intercourse can be  diagnosed by testing at the anatomic exposure site naats have  been demonstrated to have improved sensitivity and specificity  compared with culture for detecting c trachomatis at rectal  and oropharyngeal sites 553800–804 and certain naat  platforms have been cleared by fda for these anatomic sites  805 data indicate that naat performance on selfcollected  rectal swabs is comparable to cliniciancollected rectal swabs  and this specimen collection strategy for rectal c trachomatis  screening is highly acceptable among men 217806  selfcollected rectal swabs are a reasonable alternative to  cliniciancollected rectal swabs for c trachomatis screening by  naat especially when clinicians are not available or when self collection is preferred over clinician collection annual screening  for rectal c trachomatis infection should be performed among  men who report sexual activity at the rectal site extragenital  chlamydial testing at the rectal site can be considered for  females on the basis of reported sexual behaviors and exposure  through shared clinical decisionmaking bythe patient and the  provider the majority of persons with c trachomatis detected  at oropharyngeal sites do not have oropharyngeal symptoms  the clinical significance of oropharyngeal c trachomatis  infection is unclear and prevalence is low even among  populations at high risk however when gonorrhea testing  is performed at the oropharyngeal site chlamydia test results  might be reported because certain naats detect both bacteria  from a single specimen poc tests for c trachomatis among asymptomatic persons  can expedite treatment of infected persons and their sex  partners among symptomatic patients poc tests for  c trachomatis can optimize treatment by limiting unnecessary  presumptive treatment at the time of clinical decisionmaking  and improve antimicrobial stewardship thus using a poc  test will likely be a costeffective diagnostic strategy for  c trachomatis infection 807 newer naatbased poc tests  have promising performance and are becoming commercially  available 807–809 treatment treating persons with c trachomatis prevents adverse  reproductive health complications and continued sexual  transmission furthermore treating their sex partners  can prevent reinfection and infection of other partners  treating pregnant women usually prevents transmission of  c trachomatis to neonates

azithromycin 812 a published review reported  that c trachomatis was detected at the anorectal site among  33–83 of women who had urogenital c trachomatis  infection and its detection was not associated with report of  receptive anorectal sexual activity 813 although the clinical significance of oropharyngeal  c trachomatis infection is unclear and routine oropharyngeal  screening is not recommended oropharyngeal c trachomatis  can be sexually transmitted to genital sites 211814 therefore  if c trachomatis is identified from an oropharyngeal specimen  while screening for pharyngeal gonorrhea it should be treated  evidence is limited regarding the efficacy of antimicrobial  regimens for oropharyngeal chlamydia however a recently  published observational study indicates doxycycline might  be more efficacious than azithromycin for oropharyngeal  chlamydia 815 available evidence supports that doxycycline is efficacious  for c trachomatis infections of urogenital rectal and  oropharyngeal sites although azithromycin maintains high  efficacy for urogenital c trachomatis infection among women  concern exists regarding effectiveness of azithromycin for  concomitant rectal c trachomatis infection which can occur  commonly among women and cannot be predicted by reported  sexual activity inadequately treated rectal c trachomatis  infection among women who have urogenital chlamydia  can increase the risk for transmission and place women at  risk for repeat urogenital c trachomatis infection through  autoinoculation from the anorectal site 816 doxycycline is  also available in a delayedrelease 200mg tablet formulation  which requires oncedaily dosing for 7 days and is as effective  as doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days for treating  urogenital c trachomatis infection in men and women it is  more costly but also has lower frequency of gastrointestinal  side effects 817 levofloxacin is an effective treatment  alternative but is more expensive erythromycin is no longer  recommended because of the frequency of gastrointestinal side  effects which can result in nonadherence when nonadherence  to doxycycline regimen is a substantial concern azithromycin  1 g regimen is an alternative treatment option but might  require posttreatment evaluation and testing because it has  demonstrated lower treatment efficacy among persons with  rectal infection among persons receiving multidose regimens medication  should be dispensed with all doses involved onsite and in  the clinic and the first dose should be directly observed to  maximize adherence with recommended therapies onsite  directly observed singledose therapy with azithromycin should  always be available for persons for whom adherence with  multiday dosing is a considerable concern other management considerations to minimize disease transmission to sex partners persons  treated for chlamydia should be instructed to abstain from  sexual intercourse for 7 days after singledose therapy or until  completion of a 7day regimen and resolution of symptoms if  present to minimize risk for reinfection patients also should  be instructed to abstain from sexual intercourse until all of their  sex partners have been treated persons who receive a diagnosis  of chlamydia should be tested for hiv gonorrhea and syphilis  msm who are hiv negative with a rectal chlamydia

is not recommended  because the continued presence of nonviable organisms  553818819 can lead to falsepositive results a high prevalence of c trachomatis infection has been  observed among women and men who were treated  for chlamydial infection during the preceding months  753755820–822 the majority of posttreatment infections  do not result from treatment failure but rather from reinfection  caused by failure of sex partners to receive treatment or  initiation of sexual activity with a new infected partner 823  indicating a need for improved education and treatment of  sex partners repeat infections confer an elevated risk for pid  and other complications among women men and women  who have been treated for chlamydia should be retested  approximately 3 months after treatment regardless of whether  they believe their sex partners were treated scheduling the  followup visit at the time of treatment is encouraged 753  if retesting at 3 months is not possible clinicians should retest

trachomatis during  pregnancy and performing a test of cure 4 weeks after  treatment to verify chlamydial eradication these women  should also be retested 3 months after treatment and again  in the third trimester or at time of delivery and their  partners should also be tested and treated • retesting pregnant women during the third trimester who  initially tested negative but remained at increased risk for  acquiring infection eg women aged 25 years and those  aged ≥25 years who have a new sex partner more than one  sex partner a sex partner with concurrent partners or a  sex partner who has an sti and • screening at delivery those pregnant women who were not  screened for c trachomatis during pregnancy if at risk or  who had no prenatal care physicians and others caring  for the

846–848 in 1986 the gonococcal isolate surveillance  project gisp a national sentinel surveillance system was  established to monitor trends in antimicrobial susceptibilities  of urethral n gonorrhoeae strains in the united states  849 the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance guides  decisions about gonococcal treatment recommendations  and has evolved because of shifts in antimicrobial resistance  patterns during 2007 emergence of fluoroquinolone resistant n gonorrhoeae in the united states prompted cdc  to cease recommending fluoroquinolones for gonorrhea  treatment leaving cephalosporins as the only remaining  class of antimicrobials available for gonorrhea treatment in  the united states 850 reflecting concern about emerging  gonococcal resistance cdc’s 2010 std treatment guidelines  recommended dual therapy for gonorrhea with a cephalosporin  plus either azithromycin or doxycycline even if naat for  c trachomatis was negative at the time of treatment 851  however during 2006–2011 the minimum concentrations of  cefixime needed to inhibit in vitro growth of the n gonorrhoeae  strains circulating in the united states and other countries  increased demonstrating that cefixime effectiveness might be  waning 851 in addition treatment failures with cefixime or  other oral cephalosporins were reported in asia 852–855  europe 856–860 south africa 861 and canada 862863  during that time case reports of ceftriaxone treatment failures  for pharyngeal infections reported in australia 864865  japan 866 and europe were concerning 856867  consequently cdc no longer recommends cefixime as a  firstline regimen for gonorrhea treatment in the united  states 868 since 2013 the proportion of gisp isolates  that demonstrate reduced susceptibility minimal

reducedsusceptibility isolates during 2010–2011  emergence of azithromycin resistance is not concentrated  among certain populations eg msm in the western united  states azithromycin has unique pharmacokinetic properties  that might predispose to resistance due to its prolonged halflife  869870 with the exception of a small cluster of gonorrhea  strains with azithromycin resistance and reduced susceptibility  to cefixime and ceftriaxone among seven patients during 2016  all gonorrhea strains identified by gisp are susceptible to  either or both azithromycin and ceftriaxone or cefixime in  addition since 2013 antimicrobial stewardship has become  an urgent public health concern in the united states as  described in antimicrobial resistant threats in the united states  871 emergence of azithromycin resistance is not isolated to  n gonorrhoeae it has also been demonstrated in m genitalium  and such enteric pathogens as shigella and campylobacter see  mycoplasma genitalium proctitis proctocolitis and enteritis  finally concern exists regarding azithromycin treatment  efficacy for chlamydia see chlamydial infections dual therapy for gonococcal infection with ceftriaxone  and azithromycin recommended in previous guidance  might have mitigated emergence of reduced susceptibility to  ceftriaxone in n gonorrhoeae however concerns regarding  potential harm to the microbiome and the effect on other  pathogens diminishes the benefits of maintaining dual therapy  consequently only ceftriaxone is recommended for treating  gonorrhea in the united states 872

asymptomatic  trichomoniasis in highprevalence settings for women at high  risk can reduce any adverse health events and health disparities  or reduce community infection burden decisions about  screening can be guided by local epidemiology of t vaginalis  infection routine annual screening for t vaginalis among  asymptomatic women with hiv infection is recommended  because of these adverse events associated with trichomoniasis  and hiv infection extragenital t vaginalis is possible but highly uncommon  compared with genital infections a study of 500 men in san  francisco california

from sex until they and their sex partners are treated  ie when therapy has been completed and any symptoms  have resolved testing for other stis including hiv syphilis  gonorrhea and chlamydia should be performed for persons  with t vaginalis followup because of the high rate of reinfection among women treated  for trichomoniasis retesting for t vaginalis is recommended  for all sexually active women 3 months after initial treatment  regardless of whether they believe their sex partners were  treated 1371115 if retesting at 3 months is not possible  clinicians should retest whenever persons next seek medical  care 12 months after initial treatment data are insufficient  to support retesting men after treatment management of sex partners concurrent treatment of all sex partners is vital for  preventing reinfections current partners should be referred  for presumptive therapy partners also should be advised to  abstain from intercourse until they and their sex partners  have been

external dysuria and vulvar pruritus pain swelling  and redness signs include vulvar edema fissures excoriations  and thick curdy vaginal discharge most healthy women with  uncomplicated vvc have no identifiable precipitating factors  the diagnosis can be made in a woman who has signs and  symptoms of vaginitis when either a wet preparation saline  10 koh of vaginal discharge demonstrates budding  yeasts hyphae or pseudohyphae or a culture or other test  yields a positive result for a yeast species candida vaginitis is  associated with normal vaginal ph 45 use of 10 koh  in wet preparations improves the visualization of yeast and  mycelia by disrupting cellular material that might obscure  the yeast or pseudohyphae examination of a wet mount with  koh preparation should be performed for all women with  symptoms or signs of vvc and women with a positive result  should be treated for those with negative wet mounts but  existing signs or symptoms vaginal cultures for candida should  be considered if candida cultures cannot be performed for  these women empiric treatment can be considered identifying  candida by culture in the absence of symptoms or signs is not  an indication for treatment because approximately 10–20  of women harbor candida species and other yeasts in the  vagina the majority of pcr tests for yeast are not fda  cleared and providers who use these tests should be familiar  with the performance characteristics of the specific test used  yeast culture which can identify a broad group of pathogenic  yeasts remains the reference standard for diagnosis treatment

use of overthecounter  preparations is common and can lead to a delay in treatment  of other vulvovaginitis etiologies which can result in adverse  outcomes no substantial evidence exists to support using  probiotics or homeopathic medications for treating vvc followup followup typically is not required however women with  persistent or recurrent symptoms after treatment should be  instructed to return for followup visits management of sex partners uncomplicated vvc is not usually acquired through sexual  intercourse and data do not support treatment of sex partners  a minority of male sex partners have balanitis characterized  by erythematous areas on the glans of the penis in conjunction  with pruritus or irritation these men benefit from treatment  with topical antifungal agents to relieve symptoms special considerations drug allergy intolerance and adverse reactions topical agents usually cause no systemic side effects although  local burning or irritation might occur oral azoles occasionally  cause nausea abdominal pain and headache therapy with the  oral azoles has rarely been associated with abnormal elevations  of liver enzymes clinically important interactions can occur  when oral azoles are administered with other drugs 1141 complicated vulvovaginal candidiasis diagnostic considerations vaginal culture or pcr should be obtained from women  with complicated vvc to confirm clinical diagnosis and  identify non–albicans candida candida glabrata does not  form pseudohyphae or hyphae and is not easily recognized  on microscopy c albicans azole resistance is becoming more  common in vaginal isolates 11441145 and non–albicans  candida is intrinsically resistant to azoles therefore culture  and susceptibility testing should be considered for patients  who remain symptomatic recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis recurrent vvc usually defined as three or more episodes  of symptomatic vvc in 1 year affects 5 of women but  carries a substantial economic burden 1146 recurrent vvc  can be either idiopathic or secondary related to frequent  antibiotic use diabetes or other underlying host factors the  pathogenesis of recurrent vvc is poorly understood and the  majority of women with recurrent vvc have no apparent  predisposing or underlying conditions c glabrata and other  non–albicans candida species are observed in 10–20  of women with recurrent vvc conventional antimycotic  therapies are not as effective against these non–albicans yeasts  as against c albicans treatment most episodes of recurrent vvc caused by c albicans  respond well to shortduration oral or topical azole therapy  however to maintain clinical and mycologic control a longer  duration of initial therapy eg 7–14 days of topical therapy  or a 100mg 150mg or 200mg oral dose of fluconazole  every third day for a total of 3 doses days 1 4 and 7  is recommended to attempt mycologic remission before  initiating a maintenance antifungal regimen oral fluconazole ie a 100mg 150mg or 200mg dose  weekly for 6 months is the indicated maintenance regimen  if this regimen is not feasible topical treatments used  intermittently can also be considered suppressive maintenance  therapies are effective at controlling recurrent vvc but are  rarely curative longterm 1147 because c albicans azole  resistance is becoming more common susceptibility tests if  available should be obtained among symptomatic patients who  remain culture positive despite maintenance therapy these  women should be managed in consultation with a specialist severe vulvovaginal candidiasis severe vvc ie extensive vulvar erythema edema  excoriation and fissure formation is associated with lower  clinical response rates among patients treated with short courses  of topical or oral therapy either 7–14 days of topical azole or  150 mg of fluconazole in two sequential oral doses second dose  72 hours after initial dose is recommended non–albicans vulvovaginal candidiasis because approximately 50 of women with a positive culture  for non–albicans candida might be minimally symptomatic or  have no symptoms and because successful treatment is often  difficult clinicians should make every effort to exclude other  causes of vaginal symptoms for women with non–albicans  yeast 1148 the optimal treatment of non–albicans vvc  remains unknown however a longer duration of therapy  7–14 days with a nonfluconazole azole regimen oral or  topical is recommended if recurrence occurs 600 mg of boric  acid in a gelatin capsule administered vaginally once daily for  3 weeks is indicated this regimen has clinical and mycologic  eradication rates of approximately 70 1149 if symptoms  recur referral to a specialist is advised recommendations and reports 94 mmwr  july 23 2021  vol 70  no 4 us department of health and human servicescenters for disease control and prevention management of sex partners no data exist to support treating sex partners of patients with  complicated vvc therefore no recommendation can be made special considerations compromised host women with underlying immunodeficiency those with  poorly controlled diabetes or other immunocompromising  conditions eg hiv and those receiving immunosuppression  therapy eg corticosteroid treatment might not respond as  well to shortterm therapies efforts to correct modifiable  conditions should be made and more prolonged ie  7–14 days conventional treatment is necessary pregnancy vvc occurs frequently during pregnancy only topical  azole therapies applied for 7 days are recommended for use  among pregnant women epidemiologic studies indicate a  single 150mg dose of fluconazole might be associated with  spontaneous abortion 1150 and congenital anomalies  therefore it should not be used 1151 hiv infection vaginal candida colonization rates among women with  hiv infection are higher than among women without hiv  with similar demographic and risk behavior characteristics  and the colonization rates correlate with increasing severity of  immunosuppression 1152 symptomatic vvc is also more  frequent among women with hiv infection and similarly  correlates with severity of immunodeficiency 1153 in  addition among women with hiv systemic azole exposure  is associated with isolation of non–albicans candida species  from the vagina treatment for uncomplicated and complicated vvc  among women with hiv infection should not differ from  that for women who do not have hiv although long term prophylactic therapy with fluconazole 200 mg weekly  has been effective in reducing c albicans colonization and  symptomatic vvc 1154 this regimen is not recommended  for women with hiv infection in the absence of complicated  vvc 98 although vvc is associated with increased hiv  seroconversion among hivnegative women and increased  hiv cervicovaginal levels among women with hiv infection  the effect of treatment for vvc on hiv acquisition and  transmission remains unknown pelvic inflammatory disease pid comprises a spectrum of inflammatory disorders of  the upper female genital tract including any combination  of endometritis salpingitis tuboovarian abscess and pelvic  peritonitis 1155–1157 sexually transmitted organisms  especially n gonorrhoeae and c trachomatis often are  implicated recent studies report that the proportion of  pid cases attributable to n gonorrhoeae or c trachomatis is  decreasing of women who received a diagnosis of acute pid  approximately 50 have a positive test for either of those  organisms 1158–1160 microorganisms that comprise the  vaginal flora such as strict and facultative anaerobes 1160  and g vaginalis h influenzae enteric gramnegative rods and  streptococcus agalactiae have been associated with pid 1161  in addition cytomegalovirus cmv t vaginalis m hominis  and u urealyticum might be associated with certain pid cases  1072 data also indicate that m genitalium might have a role  in pid pathogenesis 765928 and might be associated with  milder symptoms 919923928 although one study failed  to demonstrate a substantial increase in pid after detection of  m genitalium in the lower genital tract 925 screening and treating sexually active women for chlamydia  and gonorrhea reduces their risk for pid 11621163 although  bv is associated with pid whether pid incidence can be  reduced by identifying and treating women with bv is unclear  1161 whether screening young women for m genitalium is  associated with a reduction in pid is unknown diagnostic considerations acute pid is difficult to diagnose because of the considerable  variation in symptoms and signs associated with this condition  women with pid often have subtle or nonspecific symptoms or  are asymptomatic delay in diagnosis and treatment probably  contributes to inflammatory sequelae in the upper genital tract  laparoscopy can be used to obtain a more accurate diagnosis  of salpingitis and a more complete bacteriologic diagnosis  however this diagnostic tool frequently is not readily available  and its use is not easily justifiable when symptoms are mild or  vague moreover laparoscopy will not detect endometritis and  might not detect subtle inflammation of the fallopian tubes  consequently a pid diagnosis usually is based on imprecise  clinical findings 1164–1166 data indicate that a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic pid  has a positive predictive value for salpingitis of 65–90  compared with laparoscopy 1167–1170 the positive  predictive value of a clinical diagnosis of acute pid depends on  the epidemiologic characteristics of the population with higher  positive predictive values among sexually active young women  particularly adolescents women attending std clinics and  recommendations and reports mmwr  july 23 2021  vol 70  no 4 95us department of health and human servicescenters for disease control and prevention those who live in communities with high rates of gonorrhea  or chlamydia regardless of positive predictive value no single  historical physical or laboratory finding is both sensitive  and specific for the diagnosis of acute pid combinations of  diagnostic findings that improve either sensitivity ie detect  more women who have pid or specificity ie exclude more  women who do not have pid do so only at the expense of the  other for example requiring two or more findings excludes  more women who do not have pid and reduces the number  of women with pid who are identified episodes of pid often go unrecognized although certain  cases are asymptomatic others are not diagnosed because  the patient or the health care provider do not recognize the  implications of mild or nonspecific symptoms or signs eg  abnormal bleeding dyspareunia and vaginal discharge even  women with mild or asymptomatic pid might be at risk for  infertility 1157 because of the difficulty of diagnosis and  the potential for damage to the reproductive health of women  health care providers should maintain a low threshold for the  clinical diagnosis of pid 1158 the recommendations for  diagnosing pid are intended to assist health care providers to  recognize when pid should be suspected and when additional  information should be obtained to increase diagnostic certainty  diagnosis and management of other causes of lower abdominal  pain eg ectopic pregnancy acute appendicitis ovarian cyst  ovarian torsion or functional pain are unlikely to be impaired  by initiating antimicrobial therapy for pid presumptive  treatment for pid should be initiated for sexually active  young women and other women at risk for stis if they are  experiencing pelvic or lower abdominal pain if no cause for  the illness other than pid can be identified or if one or more  of the following three minimum clinical criteria are present  on pelvic examination cervical motion tenderness uterine  tenderness or adnexal tenderness more specific criteria for diagnosing pid include endometrial  biopsy with histopathologic evidence of endometritis  transvaginal sonography or magnetic resonance imaging  techniques demonstrating thickened fluidfilled tubes with or  without free pelvic fluid or tuboovarian complex or doppler  studies indicating pelvic infection eg tubal hyperemia  and laparoscopic findings consistent with pid a diagnostic  evaluation that includes some of these more extensive  procedures might be warranted in certain cases endometrial  biopsy is warranted for women undergoing laparoscopy who  do not have visual evidence of salpingitis because endometritis  is the only sign of pid for certain women requiring that all three minimum criteria be present  before the initiation of empiric treatment can result in  insufficient sensitivity for a pid diagnosis after deciding  whether to initiate empiric treatment clinicians should also  consider the risk profile for stis more elaborate diagnostic  evaluation frequently is needed because incorrect diagnosis  and management of pid might cause unnecessary morbidity  for example the presence of signs of lower genital tract  inflammation predominance of leukocytes in vaginal  secretions cervical discharge or cervical friability in addition  to one of the three minimum criteria increases the specificity of  the diagnosis one or more of the following additional criteria  can be used to enhance the specificity of the minimum clinical  criteria and support a pid diagnosis • oral temperature 383°c 101°f • abnormal cervical mucopurulent discharge or cervical  friability • presence of abundant numbers of wbcs on saline  microscopy of vaginal fluid • elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate • elevated creactive protein • laboratory documentation of cervical infection with  n gonorrhoeae or c trachomatis the majority of women with pid have either mucopurulent  cervical discharge or evidence of wbcs on a microscopic  evaluation of a saline preparation of vaginal fluid ie wet  prep if the cervical discharge appears normal and no wbcs  are observed on the wet prep of vaginal fluid a pid diagnosis  is unlikely and alternative causes of pain should be considered  a wet prep of vaginal fluid also can detect the presence of  concomitant infections eg bv or trichomoniasis treatment pid treatment regimens should provide empiric broad spectrum coverage of likely pathogens multiple parenteral and  oral antimicrobial regimens have been effective in achieving  clinical and microbiologic cure in randomized clinical trials  with shortterm followup 1171–1173 however only  a limited number of studies have assessed and compared  these regimens with regard to infection elimination in the  endometrium and fallopian tubes or determined the incidence  of longterm complications eg tubal infertility and ectopic  pregnancy after antimicrobial regimens 115911641174  the optimal treatment regimen and longterm outcome of  early treatment of women with subclinical pid are unknown  all regimens used to treat pid should also be effective against  n gonorrhoeae and c trachomatis because negative endocervical  screening for these organisms does not rule out upper genital  tract infection anaerobic bacteria have been isolated from the  upper genital tract of women who have pid and data from in  vitro studies have revealed that some anaerobes eg bacteroides  fragilis can cause tubal and epithelial destruction bv is often  present among women who have pid 22116011611175  recommendations and reports 96 mmwr  july 23 2021  vol 70  no 4 us

regimens that are effective against these  microbes using regimens with anaerobic activity should  be considered treatment should be initiated as soon as the  presumptive diagnosis has been made because prevention of  longterm sequelae is dependent on early administration of  recommended antimicrobials for women with pid of mild or  moderate clinical severity parenteral and oral regimens appear  to have similar efficacy the decision of whether hospitalization  is necessary should be based on provider judgment and whether  the woman meets any of the following criteria • surgical emergencies eg appendicitis cannot be  excluded • tuboovarian abscess • pregnancy • severe illness nausea and vomiting or oral temperature  385°c 101°f • unable to follow or tolerate an outpatient oral regimen • no clinical response to oral antimicrobial therapy no evidence is available to indicate that adolescents have  improved outcomes from hospitalization for treatment of pid  and the

ruling out torsion of the spermatic cord in cases of acute  unilateral painful scrotal swelling however because partial  spermatic cord torsion can mimic epididymitis on scrotal  ultrasound differentiation between spermatic cord torsion  and epididymitis when torsion is not ruled out by ultrasound  should be made on the basis of clinical evaluation although  ultrasound can demonstrate epididymal hyperemia and  swelling associated with epididymitis it provides minimal  diagnostic usefulness for men with a clinical presentation  consistent with epididymitis a negative ultrasound does  not rule out epididymitis and thus does not alter clinical  management ultrasound should be reserved for men if torsion  of the spermatic cord is suspected or for those with scrotal pain  who cannot receive an accurate diagnosis by history physical  examination and objective laboratory findings all suspected cases of acute epididymitis should be evaluated  for objective evidence of inflammation by one of the following  poc tests • gram mb or gv stain of urethral secretions demonstrating  ≥2 wbcs per oil immersion field 737 see urethritis  these stains are preferred poc diagnostic tests for  evaluating urethritis because they are highly sensitive and  specific for documenting both urethral inflammation and  presence or absence of gonococcal infection gonococcal  infection is established

infection persons can decrease  their chances of infection by practicing consistent and correct  condom use and limiting their number of sex partners although  these interventions might not fully protect against hpv they  can decrease the chances of hpv acquisition and transmission diagnostic considerations hpv tests are available for detecting oncogenic types of hpv  infection and are used in the context of cervical cancer screening  and management or followup of abnormal cervical cytology or  histology see cervical cancer these tests should not be used  for male partners of women with hpv or women aged 25 years  for diagnosis of genital warts or as a general sti test application of 3–5 acetic acid which might cause  affected areas to turn white has been used by certain providers  to detect genital mucosa infected with hpv the routine use  of this procedure to detect mucosal changes attributed to  hpv infection is not recommended because the results do  not influence clinical management treatment treatment is directed to the macroscopic eg genital warts  or pathologic precancerous lesions caused by hpv subclinical  genital hpv infection typically clears spontaneously therefore  specific antiviral therapy is not recommended to eradicate hpv  infection precancerous lesions are detected through cervical  cancer screening hpvrelated precancer should be managed  on the basis of existing guidance see cervical cancer counseling key messages for persons with human  papillomavirus infection when counseling persons with anogenital hpv infection  the provider should discuss the following • anogenital hpv infection is common it usually infects  the anogenital area but can infect other areas including  the mouth and throat the majority of sexually active  persons get hpv at some time during their lifetime  although most never know it • partners tend to share hpv and it is not possible to  determine which partner transmitted the original  infection having hpv does not mean that a person or  his or her partner is having sex outside the relationship • persons who acquire hpv usually clear the infection  spontaneously meaning that hpv becomes undetectable  with no associated health problems • if hpv infection persists genital warts precancers and  cancers of the cervix anus penis vulva vagina head or  neck might develop • discussion of tobacco use and provision of cessation  counseling is important because of its contribution to the  progression of precancer and cancer • the types of hpv that cause genital warts are different  from the types that can cause cancer httpswwwcdcgovvaccinesprogramsvfcindexhtml httpswwwcdcgovvaccinesprogramsvfcindexhtml httpswwwcdcgovvaccinesafety httpswwwcdcgovvaccineswhoteensforhcphpvresourceshtml

prevention • many types of hpv are sexually transmitted through  anogenital contact mainly during vaginal and anal sex hpv  also might be transmitted during oral sex and genitaltogenital  contact without penetration in rare cases a pregnant woman  can transmit hpv to an infant during delivery • treatments are available for the conditions caused by hpv  but not for the virus itself • having hpv does not make it harder for a woman to get  pregnant or carry a pregnancy to term however certain  precancers or cancers that hpv can cause and the surgical  procedures needed to treat them can affect a woman’s  ability to get pregnant or carry a pregnancy to term • no hpv test can determine which hpv infection will  become undetectable and which will persist or progress to  disease however in certain circumstances hpv tests can  determine whether a woman is at increased risk for cervical  cancer these tests are not for detecting other hpvrelated  problems nor are they useful for women aged25 years  or men of any age prevention • three hpv vaccines can prevent diseases and cancers  caused by hpv the 2vhpv 4vhpv and 9vhpv vaccines  protect against the majority of cervical cancer cases  although the 4vhpv and 9vhpv vaccines also protect  against the majority of genital warts only 9vhpv vaccine  is available in the united states hpv vaccines are safe  and effective and are

clinical decisionmaking is  recommended regarding hpv vaccination for certain  adults aged 27–45 years who are not adequately vaccinated  per guidance httpswwwcdcgovmmwrvolumes68 wrpdfsmm6832a3hpdf  • condoms used consistently and correctly can lower the  chances of acquiring and transmitting hpv and  developing hpvrelated diseases eg genital warts or  cervical cancer however because hpv can infect areas  not covered by a condom condoms might not fully protect  against hpv • limiting the number of sex partners can reduce the risk  for hpv however even persons with only one lifetime  sex partner

nononcogenic hpv types 6 or 11 these types can be  commonly identified before or at the same time anogenital  warts are detected 1206 hpv types 16 18 31 33 and 35  also are occasionally identified in anogenital warts usually  as infections with hpv 6 or 11 and can be associated with  foci of highgrade squamous intraepithelial lesion hsil  particularly among persons who have hiv infection in  addition to anogenital warts hpv types 6 and 11 have been  associated with conjunctival nasal oral and laryngeal warts anogenital warts are usually asymptomatic however  depending on the size and anatomic location they can  be painful or pruritic they are usually flat papular or  pedunculated growths on the genital mucosa anogenital warts  occur commonly at certain anatomic sites including around  the vaginal introitus under the foreskin of the uncircumcised  penis and on the shaft of the circumcised penis warts can  also occur at multiple sites in the anogenital epithelium or  within the anogenital tract eg cervix vagina urethra  perineum perianal skin anus or scrotum intraanal warts  are observed predominantly in persons who have had receptive  anal intercourse however they also can occur among men and  women who have not had a history of anal sexual contact prevention anogenital warts have decreased among adolescents  young women and heterosexual men with use of hpv  vaccination in multiple countries including the united states  12031207–1216 diagnostic considerations diagnosis of anogenital warts is usually made by visual  inspection but can be confirmed by biopsy which is indicated  if lesions are atypical eg pigmented indurated affixed to  underlying tissue bleeding or ulcerated lesions biopsy might  also be indicated in the following circumstances particularly  if the patient is immunocompromised including those with  hiv infection the diagnosis is uncertain the lesions do not  respond to standard therapy or the disease worsens during  therapy hpv testing is not recommended for anogenital wart  diagnosis because test results are not confirmatory and do not  guide genital wart management some anogenital lesions can  resemble anogenital warts

is large surgical therapy has the advantage of eliminating the  majority of warts at a single visit although recurrence can  occur surgical removal requires substantial clinical training  additional equipment and sometimes a longer office visit after  local anesthesia is applied anogenital warts can be physically  destroyed by electrocautery in which case no additional  hemostasis is required care should be taken to control the  depth of electrocautery to prevent scarring alternatively the  warts can be removed either by tangential excision with a pair of  fine scissors or a scalpel by co2 laser or by curettage because  most warts are exophytic this procedure can be accomplished  with a resulting wound that only extends into the upper dermis  hemostasis can be achieved with an electrocautery unit or in  cases of minor bleeding a chemical styptic eg an aluminum  chloride solution suturing is neither required nor indicated  in the majority of cases for patients with large or extensive  warts surgical therapy including co2 laser might be most  beneficial such therapy might also be useful for intraurethral  warts particularly for those persons whose warts have not

the following • if left untreated genital warts might resolve stay the same  or increase in size or number the types of hpv that cause  genital warts are different from the types that can cause cancer • women with genital warts do not need pap tests more  often than other women • time of hpv acquisition cannot be definitively  determined genital warts can develop months or years  after acquiring hpv • hpv types that cause genital warts can be passed on to  another person even without visible signs of warts sex  partners tend to share hpv even though signs of hpv  eg warts might occur in only one or neither partner • although genital warts are common and benign certain  persons might experience considerable psychosocial impact  after receiving this diagnosis • although genital warts can be treated such treatment does  not cure the virus itself for this reason genital warts often  recur after treatment especially during the first 3 months • because genital warts can be sexually transmitted persons  with genital warts benefit from testing for other stis  hpv might remain present and can still be transmitted  to partners even after the warts are gone • condoms might lower the chances of transmitting genital  warts if used consistently and correctly however hpv  can infect areas that are not covered by a condom and  might not fully protect against hpv • a vaccine is available for males and females to prevent  genital warts gardasil 9 but it will not treat existing hpv  or genital warts this vaccine can prevent the majority of  cases of genital warts among persons who have not yet  been exposed to wartcausing types of hpv management of sex partners persons should inform current partners about having genital  warts because the types of hpv that cause warts can be passed  on to partners partners should be counseled that they might  already have hpv despite no visible signs of warts therefore  hpv testing of sex partners of persons with genital warts is  not recommended partners might benefit from a physical  examination to detect genital warts and tests for other stis no  recommendations can be made regarding informing future sex  partners about a diagnosis of genital warts because the duration  of viral persistence after warts have resolved is unknown special considerations pregnancy podofilox podophyllin and sinecatechins should not be  used during pregnancy imiquimod appears to pose low risk  but should be avoided until more data are available anogenital  warts can proliferate and become friable during pregnancy  although removal of warts during pregnancy can be considered  resolution might be incomplete or poor until pregnancy is  complete rarely hpv types 6 and 11 can cause respiratory  papillomatosis among infants and children

also  recommendations and reports 106 mmwr  july 23 2021  vol 70  no 4 us department of health and human servicescenters for disease control and prevention is unclear 1230 therefore cesarean delivery should not be  performed solely to prevent transmission of hpv infection to  the newborn cesarean delivery is indicated for women with  anogenital warts if the pelvic outlet is obstructed or if vaginal  delivery would result in excessive bleeding pregnant women  with anogenital warts should be counseled about the low risk  for warts on the larynx of their infants or children recurrent  respiratory papillomatosis hiv and other causes of immunosuppression persons with hiv infection or who are otherwise  immunosuppressed are more likely to develop anogenital  warts than those who do not have hiv 1231 moreover  such persons can have larger or more numerous lesions  might not respond to therapy as well as those who are  immunocompetent and might have more frequent recurrences  after treatment 12311232–1234 despite these factors data  do not support altered approaches to treatment for persons  with hiv infection squamous cell carcinomas arising in or  resembling anogenital

management of  abnormal cervical cancer screening tests 1247 hpv testing  or cotesting is preferred to cytology alone for surveillance  after an abnormal screening test result these guidelines base  management recommendations on casebycase assessment  of risk considering past screening history and current results  see followup patients with abnormal cervical cancer  screening test results should be counseled about those results  see counseling messages the following additional management considerations are  associated with performing pap tests and hpv tests • cytology pap tests and hpv tests should not be  considered screening tests for stis • all persons with a cervix should receive cervical cancer  screening regardless of sexual orientation or gender  identity ie those who identify as lesbian bisexual  heterosexual or transgender • a conventional cytology test in which the sample is  smeared onto a dry slide should ideally be scheduled for  10–20 days after the first day of menses liquidbased  cytology can be performed at any time during the  menstrual cycle • if specific infections other than hpv eg chlamydia or  gonorrhea are identified at the visit a repeat cytology test  after appropriate treatment for those infections might be  indicated however in most instances even in the  presence of certain severe cervical infections cytology  tests will be reported as satisfactory for evaluation and  reliable final reports can be produced without the need to  repeat the cytology test after treatment • the presence of a mucopurulent discharge should not  postpone cytology testing the test can be performed after  removal of the discharge with a salinesoaked cotton swab • hpv testing can be performed either as a separate test or  by using material from the liquidbased cytology specimen • in the absence of other indications the presence of external  genital warts does not warrant more frequent cervical  cancer screening • the sequence of cytology testing in relation to collection  of other endocervical specimens does not influence pap test  results or their interpretation 600 typically vaginal  specimens are preferred for chlamydia and gonorrhea  screening however during a pelvic examination endocervical  specimens for sti testing can be collected first • persons who have had a total hysterectomy with removal  of the cervix do not require screening unless cervical  intraepithelial neoplasia cin 2 cin 3 or adenocarcinoma  in situ was diagnosed within the previous 20 years  1751247 if the cervix remains intact after a supracervical  hysterectomy regularly scheduled pap tests should be  performed as indicated 1248–1250 • health care facilities that train providers on cytology test  collection and use simple quality assurance measures are  more likely to obtain satisfactory test results as determined  by the laboratory • the use of instruments designed to sample the cervical  transformation zone eg cytobrushes improves the  accuracy of cytology tests 1251 • both liquidbased and conventional cytology are acceptable  because they have similar testperformance characteristics • at an initial visit providers should ask patients about their  recent cytology test and hpv results and any history of  evaluation and treatment eg loop electrosurgical  excision procedure and colposcopy to assist with  management effort should be made to obtain copies of  recent results the importance and frequency of screening  should be reinforced counseling persons might believe the cytology pap test or hpv test  screens for conditions other than cervical cancer or they  might be confused by abnormal results 1252–1254 health  care providers as trusted sources of information about hpv  infections and abnormal cytology test results have an important  role in educating persons about hpv and can moderate the  psychosocial impact of abnormal results 12551256 persons  should be counseled on the risks uncertainties and benefits  of screening 1741257 an abnormal cytology test or a positive hpv test can  cause shortterm anxiety stress fear and confusion possibly  decreasing the patient’s ability to absorb and retain information  and acting as a barrier to followup care 1258–1261 a  positive hpv test might elicit concerns about partners worries  about disclosure and feelings of guilt anger and stigmatization  1260 providers should frame hpv positivity in a neutral  nonstigmatizing context and emphasize its common  asymptomatic and transient nature providers also should  emphasize that hpv infections often are shared between  partners but it is often not possible to know the origin of an  hpv infection hpv tests might become positive many years  after initial exposure due to reactivation of latent infections  in both male and female partners having an hpv infection  should not raise concerns about a male partner’s health 1262  providers should communicate the meaning of both the  cytology and hpv test results to patients at screening providers also should screen for tobacco use and  perform cessation counseling wwwacogorgclinical clinicalguidancecommitteeopinionarticles201109

cdcgovstdhpvfactsbrochureshtm patient navigators can  be effective in improving both screening and followup after  abnormal results 1267 key messages about cervical cancer screening when counseling persons about cervical cancer screening  the provider should discuss the following • cervical cancer can be prevented with regular screening tests  like the pap test cytology and hpv tests those at average  risk should start getting cytology tests at age 21 years • the cytology test can find abnormal cervical cells which  could lead to cervical cancer over time and an hpv test  detects hpv infection of the cervix the hpv test can be  used alone for cervical cancer screening or at the same time  as the cytology test known as cotesting for those aged  ≥30 years to 65 years the hpv test is also used after a  cytology test result of atypical squamous cells of  undetermined significance ascus among persons aged  25 years known as reflex hpv testing • positive cytology and hpv tests are markers of cervical  precancerous lesions which often do not cause symptoms  until they become invasive appropriate followup is  essential to ensure that cervical cancer does not develop • hpv is a common infection and is often controlled by  the body without any medical interventions a positive  hpv test does not mean that a person has cancer • providers should emphasize that hpv infections often are  shared between partners and it is often not possible to know  the origin of an hpv infection hpv tests might become  positive many years after initial exposure due to reactivation  of latent infections in both male and female partners management of sex partners the benefit of disclosing a positive hpv test to current  and future sex partners is unclear the following counseling  messages can be communicated to sex partners • sex partners do not need to be tested for hpv • sex partners tend to share hpv sex partners of persons  with hpv infection also are likely have an hpv infection • female sex partners of men who disclose they had a previous  female partner with hpv should be screened at the same  intervals as women with average risk no data are available  to suggest that more frequent screening is of benefit • when used correctly and consistently condoms might  lower the risk for hpv infection and might decrease the  time to clear in those with hpv infection however hpv  can infect areas not covered by the condom and condoms  might not fully protect against hpv 2425 additional messages for partners include the messages for persons  with hpv see cervical cancer screening counseling messages screening recommendations in special  populations pregnancy persons who are pregnant should be screened at the same  intervals as those who are not a swab ayre’s

of approximately  28 days range 15–50 days 1296 hav replicates in the liver  and is shed in high concentrations in feces from 2–3 weeks  before to 1 week after the onset of clinical illness hav infection  produces a selflimited disease that does not result in chronic  infection or chronic liver disease however approximately  10 of patients experience a relapse of symptoms during  the 6 months after acute illness acute liver failure from  hepatitis a is rare overall casefatality rate 05 the risk  for symptomatic infection is directly related to age with  approximately 70 of adults having symptoms compatible  with acute viral hepatitis and the majority of children having  either asymptomatic or unrecognized infection antibody  produced in response to hav infection persists for life and  confers protection against reinfection 1297 hav infection is primarily transmitted by the fecaloral route  by either persontoperson contact or through consumption  of contaminated food or water 1298 transmission of hav  during sexual activity probably results from fecaloral contact  although viremia occurs early during infection and can persist  for weeks after symptom onset bloodborne transmission of  hav is uncommon 1299 transmission by saliva has not  been demonstrated in the united states of the hepatitis a cases accompanied by  risk information a particular risk was identified

united states include msm persons who  use injecting drugs sexual and household contacts those  experiencing homelessness international travelers those with  children attending a nursery childcare or preschool and  persons working in such settings 13372 diagnostic considerations diagnosis of hav infection cannot be made on a clinical  basis alone but requires serologic testing presence of igm  antibody to hav is diagnostic of acute hav infection a  positive test for total antihav indicates immunity to hav  infection but does not differentiate current from previous hav  infection although usually not sensitive enough to detect the  low level of protective antibody after vaccination antihav  tests also might be positive after hepatitis a vaccination treatment patients with acute hav infection usually require only  supportive care with no restrictions in diet or activity  hospitalization might be necessary for patients who become  dehydrated because of nausea and vomiting and is crucial  for patients with signs or symptoms of acute liver failure  medications that might cause liver damage or are metabolized  by the liver should be used with caution among persons with  hav

b virus infection the incubation period for hbv infection from time of  exposure to symptom onset ranges from 6 weeks to 6 months  the highest concentrations of hbv are located in blood with  lower concentrations in other body fluids including wound  exudates semen vaginal secretions and saliva 13091310  hbv is more infectious and more stable in the environment  than other bloodborne pathogens eg hcv or hiv hbv infection can be either selflimited or chronic  among adults approximately half of newly acquired hbv  infections are symptomatic and approximately 1 of reported  cases result in acute liver failure and death 1311 risk for  chronic infection is inversely related to age at acquisition  approximately 90 of infected infants and 30 of infected  children aged 5 years become chronically infected compared  with 2–6 of persons who become infected as adults 1312  among persons with chronic hbv infection the risk for  premature death from cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma  is 15–25 1313 hbv is efficiently transmitted by percutaneous or mucous  membrane exposure to hbvinfected blood or body fluids  that contain hbv the primary risk factors associated with  infection among adolescents and adults are unprotected sex  with an infected partner having multiple partners men having  sex with men having history of other stis and injecting drug  use 233 in addition studies have demonstrated other modes  of hbv transmission including premastication and lapses  in health care infection control procedures as less common  sources of transmission 1314–1317 cdc’s national strategy for eliminating transmission of hbv  infection includes prevention of perinatal infection through  routine screening of all pregnant women for hbsag and  immunoprophylaxis of infants born to mothers with hbsag  or mothers whose hbsag status is unknown routine infant  vaccination vaccination of previously unvaccinated children  and adolescents through age 18 years and vaccination of  previously unvaccinated adults at increased risk for infection  12 high vaccination coverage rates with subsequent  decreases in acute hbv infection incidence have been achieved  among infants and adolescents 1318 the vaccination of  persons as children and adolescents likely has led to improved  vaccination coverage among adults aged 30 years 1319 and  corresponding lower rates of acute hbv infection among this  group in contrast vaccination coverage among the majority  of adult populations at high risk aged ≥30 years eg persons  with multiple sex partners msm and injecting drug users  has remained low 13201321 these groups account for the  highest rates of preventable acute infections 1213191322  std clinics and other health care settings providing sti  services to adults at high
